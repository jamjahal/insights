It only makes users add in stuff that either isn't true - or is just garbage to fit the extra words as I have done here.  Why have a minimum word count?

Most of the times the user that is trying to use the form doesn't know how to use html/css to edit the style but it needs to make the form to blend with the company branding style. I also recommend having a heatmap tool to evaluate our landing pages.

They make it easy to understand the design and features of their platform in relation to the latest marketing concepts and trends.  Bouncing between the admin dashboard and the HubSpot academy proves to be a great opportunity to self-onboard.  The training and support HubSpot allows one to grow as a marketer, even when having little to no background in the field.  We're able to expand our website by building landing and pillar pages, monitor our website and social media traffic, experiment with different types of gated content, enhance our email campaign efforts and so much more.", "What do you dislike?": "2)\tI thought the organization of the Admin dashboard was difficult to navigate at first but taking the Marketing Fundamentals three-day in-person training helped to connect the dots.  One big setback would be the missing feature of copying work done in a Sandbox account over to the live account. We're a small marketing team and use the automation features in HubSpot to our advantage but having to redo work in both accounts takes way too much of our time.  ", "Recommendations to others considering the product:": "If you're a small marketing team, the automation software is a huge help.  If you integrate with Microsoft CRM, make sure you have internal support that can help to oversee the syncing process.  We used HubSpot partners and we had a really hard time fixing issues through a ticketing support system that was offered.  If you are going to be the admin, I suggest reviewing the video training in the HubSpot Academy to familiarize yourself with their marketing concepts and how they layout the admin features/tools in the dashboard.  Then, sign up for the in-person, three-day Marketing Fundamentals class, and this will help you to connect all of the dots and have a hands-on experience.  It was a great way to network to see how others are going to use the tool and to already meet people in the local HubSpot community.  The Community Social platforms are a great resource, too!  ", "What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?": "3)\tAs a small marketing team working at a global company, the integration with our Microsoft CRM has made it easier to compile the right contacts into segregated lists and takes away some of the manual admin work.  Another advantage as a global company is that it\u2019s an easy platform to share with marketing teams around the world.  We can look at each other's communications, ask questions, recycle/copy content and run our own social platforms.  To be able to automate emails and schedule social posts is a big timesaver.  It takes time to create gated content and now with HubSpot, we are able to monitor and analyze the traffic looking at and downloading the content to see what works best and is more sought out by end-users.  Using the Email feature has been giving us great insight as to who is looking at our communications and even helped us troubleshoot why some partners have been missing some mailings.  Our team is not too technically savvy so the design tools to build forms and landing pages is a huge help.  We\u2019re able to expand our website without having to know code.  "}}

As a company, they really have thought of everything. Their platform is so extensive. No matter your marketing needs, they have a feature that supports it. What I like most about HubSpot is the analytics. You can customize your dashboard so you see the metrics that matter most to you and your company, every time you log in. Our company is extremely data-driven, so it is nice having data on literally everything. How many times an individual person opened your email, whether they read or skimmed it, how your campaign is performing, etc. Their analytics are amazing.

We are a young 4 year company, and if HubSpot's pricing was what it is now four years ago, there is no way we would have been able to purchase the software and then start selling the services we do now to clients.

Because I manage so many different social media accounts on so many different social media platforms, posting one thing at a time would take forever and waste so much time. Instead, I am able to very clearly map out all of an account's posts weeks in advance. I also love that I can post duplicate content on multiple Facebook or Instagram accounts at the same time.

This helps prevent conflicting posts at the exact same time on an account and ensures I am scheduling posts throughout the day to maintain engagement on the account in question.", "What do you dislike?": "There are a couple drawbacks to HubSpot's social media tool versus other scheduling tools. First, you cannot post image carousels (multiple images in one post) to Instagram via the HubSpot platform. This limits what we can do and limits our ability to easily test different post types to see which ones perform the best. I've also notices that sometimes the formatting of a post caption in HubSpot does not show up correctly once in the caption on the actual platform's post.

We felt we were led to believe that we would receive a higher level of support, particularly within the back-end tools for website and eDM dev work, than what was available in reality. What was sold as a largely \"drag and drop\" website build tool, required vast HTML experience, which, as a marketing team of 2 people, we do not have.

Their platform has really impressed me with its user-friendly GUI, which allows you to spend more time being productive, and less time trying to figure the system out. My experience with other similar software has been that you need training on the software just to get started, and productivity doesn't actually occur until after months of setup and testing. I was able to start developing marketing campaigns and dashboard reports within days of receiving access.

A feature that logs incoming calls and not just outgoing calls would be useful as well, but I think that they are actually working on both of these. On the surface, I have no complaints, and anything negative I have to say would be very particular that only extensive users would identify with.

What benefits have you realized?": "The biggest issue I have had with Hubspot is email deliverability, and it all seems to be tied into their shared IP address. First, when you begin sending emails through Hubspot, you will immediately find that a significant portion of your list is \"unmailable\" according to Hubspot (roughly 10% in my experience). Hubspot will say this is because of a prior hard bounce from another Hubspot client. However, I've tested these contacts and mailed them from another provider and found that roughly half were indeed deliverable, and showed really strong engagement (opens, clicks, filled out forms, etc). The other issue with deliverability is you will find results for your emails will likely drop significantly when you begin using Hubspot. I have seen this in 2 completely different environments where i used HS. Opens and clicks will drop by a good margin--in my case, 20%. Hubspot will blame you and say you are not following email best practices. But this was not a problem until the day I started sending email from Hubspot. I don't expect Hubspot to admit the issue, but I'm certain this is related to the shared IP address and the high volume of email they are sending from multiple clients. "}}

As of now, we have over 1,000 potential companies and 692 contacts added into our CRM. This includes distributors,  customers, competition, and high priority accounts. This allows for transparency among our employees and keeps everyone up to date with the communications between our team and our customers.

I know its difficult due to privacy policies on different platforms but there are certain features and tools that are integrated with some platforms but not others.

Also from a social standpoint, there are issues with the bulk upload feature.Its a great idea, but there are so many limitations that we do not really find it useful. For one ti can be only used for Twitter, no other platforms, you can't choose the image for the post, etc.", "Recommendations to others considering the product:": "The HubSpot Community where you submit proposals for features has a lot of great ideas.

HubSpot's software rocks, but their support really makes them shine.", "What do you dislike?": "The price for all this amazingness is a bit steep for my industry (non-profit/ministry). So it's been a bit of a challenge to convince my organization to stay with it. Thanks to great results it's gotten easier.", "Recommendations to others considering the product:": "The price may seem steep, but if you can afford one year with HubSpot, do it. I believe that the software and support will have paid for itself within that time if you really utilize it.", "What problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?": "Purposeful website visits that lead to relationships, rather than dropping every potential contact out the bottom of an un-optimized site. Nurturing leads into customers by providing relevant content and encouraging stories that show results of donations to our donors."}}

This makes it easier to know when to time your next reply without wondering if they even got or read your email to them. Another great feature is being able to create Facebook and Instagram ads that trigger a form to fill out.
