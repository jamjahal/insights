I would like the ability to customize lead scoring a bit more to allow for incremental scoring for certain repeated actions.,,
"The fact that is not really built for multiple brands within one company, at least not the versions below   Enterprise.",,
I have not found anything I dislike about it.,,
It would be good to automate sequences and task management,,
"Currently, you can't share a document on LinkedIn through HubSpot",,
Hubspot reports are a little tough to understand because of their layout.,,
"As with all platforms, learning to customize content and make email and landing pages look amazing requires some specialization. ",,
"There's still some functionality issues, such as an editable lead score that I would love to see added.",,
The deep HTML on pages took a little investigating as did tracking 3rd party campaigns within Hubspot.,,
"However, I don't like the tracking URLS and alt-text replacement for the paid accounts.",,
"As i have little crm knowledge the learning curve is quite steep, there are so many options that I don't know where to start - but this is less a negative aspect of the product, more a user issue.",,
Landing pages are not always designed for mobile.,,

A few things.,,
I only wish HubSpot offered survey functionality,wishes:UX:Actionable:features,
"As a web developer, I dislike some of the aspects of page development. ",,
"I don't like that the LP builder is so complicated, not user-friendly and requires a developer.",,
The only downside I can think of is that there is sometimes a brief lag in pages or other designs updating on the published end but this has not been a common occurrence.,,
"When you update / adjust single elements or modules on a page, Hubspot will jump up and down on the page after saving, so there is a lot of scrolling involved to get back to the point where you have just been editing.",,
"Nothing really, so far I haven't run into anything I don't like.",,
"I wish that you could do a bit more, like post multiple images to instagram or add video captions to facebook, but i get that that might be difficult and has to do with the social platforms themselves. ",Actionable:wishes:features,
"The tables are not very user-friendly, personally I still prefer to use google sheet or Microsoft excel instead of Hubspot",,
Sometimes the simplicity of the tool can reduce the ability to custom format things and requires work arounds to work the way I want it,,
Adding the functionality to have lists of companies and not just contacts hamper productivity at times.,,
"It's just like an apple product: pretty, intuitive, and incredibly difficult to creatively customize to your needs without shelling out for templates or knowing significant coding.",,
They are still technically behind a number of other providers in terms of RSS api's and technical requests/suggestions seem to get lost in the ether.,,
Some of the features such as website pages could be released for smaller packages but limited maybe in amount of pages you can create.,,
"I would say the biggest dislikes are the price, and the limitations in the email and landing page builders.",,
Hubspot is continually growing and the constant updates can be frustrating.,,
Integrating with our Sales CRM is difficult.,,
Some times when you ask something in support just send you information that doesn't answer your doubt,,
The tracking is sometimes convoluted and inaccurate.,,
Not enough freedom when creating landing pages,,
"The connection with social media is still weak and could be improved, so the Inbound strategy links better with the activity in Linkedin, Twitter, etc.",,
"Can be a little limited as a result of it's simplicity, and is too easy to setup multiple, overlapping campaigns, workflows emails, CTAs etc.",,
Pretty sharp learning curve in the beginning and to become advanced.,,
"As exciting as it's been to see HubSpot roll out quality new tools for sales, customer service and conversations, some features take a while to reach a level of sophistication where they're best in class and fully integrated with the overall stack.",,
The downside I'm experiencing in hubspot is that we cannot segregate the properties that we need for carrier and enterprise products.,,
"One of the only things I dislike, is the fact that whenever I am creating an for Facebook, I have to leave the easy hubspot UI and go into the hard to grasp Facebook Ads Manager UI.",,
limited social media features (less than what is native in the social platform) & glitches in the posting features / emoticons,,
Sometimes the statistics don't match the exact number in the channel's analytics.,,
It's not really a dislike - it's more that the tool is so robust and I only use such a small portion of it.,,
Hubspot can be updated to allow us to organize our leads a little better by giving us more filtered options.,,
There are some limitations on integrations with other tools such as Salesforce,,
"Comparing to other tools in the similar set, there is nothing wrong here with Hubspot.",,
Nothing stands out as an area of opportunity for Hubspot currently,,
But it does this very well already.,,
I spent a few hours integrating the Chat Bot and then it suddenly disappeared.,,
There are few features which lack in the Hubspot.,,
The mobile app could be a bit more user friendly - UX wise,,
"Once you have a decent amount of data in HubSpot, you will find it is very difficult to transfer to another tool.",,
and you are not allowed to send emails to contacts before they explicitly subscribe to your email (which can be a good thing for the audience).,,
I wish it wasn't one huge list but that it was easier to divide up and find certain emails.,UX:wishes,
"Compared to Mailchimp, it is difficult to manage content.",,
That is why I couldn't rate hubspot a full 10.,,
It would be easier to copy the format and swap out the text as needed.,,
"Should Hubspot ever get into a crisis, we will all be affected.",,
We regularly scan lists to make sure those who are unsubscribed are then removed and it requires removal and re-uploading the list.,,
"The only complaint is that hubspot doesn’t have social media planning for Instagram, so we are still having to take time everyday to post on this platform.",,
I don't have any real dislikes about Hubspot.,,
Some examples in the videos seemed outdated or used for personal gain/attention.,,
"Overall, the analytics don't 100% make sense to me all the time.",,
Limited email & landing page templates.,,
We recently discovered this when several emails weren't delivered from people who had never hard bounced from our emails.,bugs:Actionable:features,
"The software have a steep learning curve, other than that all is good.",,
"I do not like the leads section, and the difficulty level of adding information to the preview portion of the contact or company.",,
If you can have both in one platform it would be great.,,
"We have an industry-specific client CRM, which would cost a fortune to integrate a bi-directional API w/HS - the work-around is cumbersome and error prone.  ",integrations,
"Also, more options should be available for data exports, so we could at-least create reports manually.",,
"Hubspot has a few limitations on the following aspects: web analytics (it does not allow you to export data per date and time, that we could get easily through Google Analytics), social (GIF and boomerangs are not supported) and web/email design (more advanced functionalities like hoover effect on images require coding skills and are not available through the interface).",,
"After a workflow is live, if I find a mistake from myself or a colleague, having to make copies of workflows to correct it makes it kind of messy and hard to keep track.",,
I could not think of anything bad to say about our experience.,,
"If HubSpot could just improve their (free) reporting capabilities, we would switch from Salesforce.com as our CRM in a heartbeat.",,
You can't even choose the colour of font.,,
"Instead, we were forced to figure it out ourselves because no one seemed to ever have answers for us.",,
"Also, the social media deployment section of the site doesn't work as expected (often).",,
I found myself drifting off and getting distracted often during the longer 20+ minute videos.,,
It is very user friendly and intuitive.,,
"I have experienced occasional downtime and have discovered a few bugs in the platform, which support has always very promptly addressed and fixed.",,
and I didn't have time for that.,,
"It can sometimes be challenging to tag other company's in posts, and I can easily forget to add the posts to a campaign because the drop down menu is at the very bottom of the posts.",,
You are expected to commit to a tool to keep track of all the data you collect.,,
"Sometimes is hard to keep a track on specifi data such as forecasts, win rates and also customizing with formulas is someting that could add value in the reporting capabilities.",,
There isn't much that I dislike when it comes to Hubspot...have yet to find something.,,
Sometimes HubSpot needs a powerful internet connection because Even if a company has a strong connection for anyone else.,,
Everything seems to be where I need it to be.,,
"so you have to click each post to edit and add an image. 
",,
There is not much to dislike because Hubspot has thought of everything.,,
Also would love if they were able to integrate directly with Netsuite as right now we have to use a 3rd party integration tool.,,
"I can't do that?""",,
Can be overwhelming to navigate without training.,,
Email and landing page design and layouts are difficult to maneuver- not easy drag and drop like in Mail Chimp or other providers.,,
"Worked well in my b2b role, but can't see it working as well in my new b2c work.",,
"When you company is growing, it gets hard for the sales team to follow up and update everything we need to make reports with real information.",,
"In the span of time of using this tool, one dilemma that we experienced was the cutting in and out of the line whenever we take phone calls due to intermittent internet connection which significantly affected the way we communicate with our customers.",,
"They have so much to offer, I feel the classes could be broken up as shorter videos that are less repetitive from each other, and easier to get through.",,
HubSpot gets ridiculously expensive when you have a significant number of contacts.,,
email modules not as easy to work with as we'd like.,,
We're a small marketing team and use the automation features in HubSpot to our advantage but having to redo work in both accounts takes way too much of our time.,,
They charge quite a lot for contacts so,,
It's not a major issue but uploading a file for social media is slightly cumbersome.,,
The workflow/drip campaign is clunky.,,
Hubspot can be challenging in the sense that it is not quite as intuitive as you may think when attempting to build more robust campaigns.,,
It's easy to use and support is always a question away if you need help.,UX:support,
"It's not the most expensive, but it's far from the least expensive.",,
The application is loaded with features and definitely as a learning curve.,,
"Well so far I can't find anything that upsets me, if I have to say something I think it would be its high package costs",,
Lastly we find Hubspot is an extremely expensive product for how much we use it.,,
", I just wish I had more time to learn all of its features to use it fully.",,
I sometimes have trouble working within the limitations in design.,,
There are limitations when it comes to paid ads in HubSpot.,,
The thing to dislike would be the cost.,,
"Hupspot makes the process of sales more efficient and easy. 
",,
The product demos well but,,
"Comparison and overall email program success need help though.
",,
"- it seems as if the format doesn't always match, even though I use the Edit picture option as well.",,
There's not really anything I dislike about HubSpot!,,
"If you already have an in-house developer, then you won't have a problem.",,
I dislike that many of the templates are extra costs.,,
Design elements for emails and landing pages are a little hard to accomplish at times.,,
"They are not negative things, they are things that I would like to see added.",,
Such a shame as they are such a powerful engagement tool when on the side of a page.,,
"There are points where you need a professional developer. 
",,
That it requires the right agency for SFDC integration.,,
"There are some elements that i would have assumed were part of our package, but we have to pay extra for these and it has been disappointing to learn this as our budget does not stretch to cover them.",,
I also dislike that Instagram is not integrated in the social media publishing tools.,,
They need to enhance their website builder.,,
"I also think, while HubSpot has SEO tools, they are limited and could be improved.",UX:Actionable:integrations,
The only drawback is the price for the tool.,,

"Workflow and sequence do not work together, though I know these are two separate features of marketing and Sales.",,
I have yet to find a way to edit or erase specific attributes for HubSpot sales pipeline entries for multiple entries.,,
No complaints yet!,,
Some are based on the functionality you need and others are based on usage.,,
Sometimes we run into very weird bugs that takes support days to figure out.,,
This is a question of adaptation and acceptance of decisions in favor of HubSpot's productivity.,,
"I can port over templates, landing pages, and emails to other Hubspot accounts",,
"The price, wow",,
"My biggest complaint would be about the Instagram publishing feature, which is not the fault of HubSpot.",,
"Also, upon completion of our first year, the product become so expensive it was really difficult to justify keeping it.",,
"If you fail to manage the growth of your contacts, you might be trapped in a high billing tier that might be costly.",,
It was hard to tell why the system wasn't accepting my changes.,,
There are few drawbacks that can be seen in this software as you will not get the full valos of the campaign if you are producing separate content that prices are somewhat high.,,
There is an add-on you have to pay a lot more (for SMB) a month to be able to get all of the reporting tools that makes Hubspot really awesome.,,
"For some reason I always have to send a test email quite a few times and refresh the page before minor formatting issues are resolved, regardless of how much I edit the HTML!",,
"and it would automatically bring up that file with all related documents, but that is me dreaming.",,
"Other than that, I like hubspot a lot.",,
I think Hubspot should add a feature to import directly from a document to a blog.,,
"It is worth it, but I had help with this as I would not be able to complete it on my own.",,
"For instance, when I am uploading a logo it adds a code to shrink it so the image looks blurry.",,
They have an free integration with Vidyard that is just a teaser to buy a more expensive full integration.,price:integrations,
"For example, at the time of writing this, Later.com has scheduling Instagram stories.",,
"(Sales team’s promises contradicted account managers promises, both contradicted FAQs and learning center)

I wish the training was a bit more in depth when it gets to the more complex parts.,,
Filters available in Lists that aren't available in Workflows is another.,,
"For example, being able to reset a contact's Hubspot score to 0 rather than using subtraction, or the Reporting tool being clunky and difficult to use.",,

"HubSpot is invaluable in tracking your lead gen efforts; however, depending on your budget, you may need to develop ways or leverage other software for useful reporting and dashboards.",,
Customer Service -,,
"I wish there were more design options for landing pages, emails, etc.",,
They did this without any notice.,,
The only things I don't like.,,
I don't like that you can only have a few templates saved between your work group.,,
Not much functionality in regards to reporting.,,
There has also been some trial and error as far as editing information in a fixed template element then losing the work that's been done later.,,
"Although, they can also opt to use their free sales & CRM tools.",,
"so far its use has been fantastic to fulfill its purpose so I do not see many negative aspects, should further improve the clarity of the calls.",,
Designing and customization of the template could still be better but much better than other competitors,,
Check the HTML: there's probably three different width calls throughout the <img> tag.,,
"They also should work faster to update their FAQs, since they often reference previous designs and changed systems.",,
"The lists and workflows can be unnecessarily complicates due to some oversights (for example, not being able to merge ""if/then"" parameters).",,
HubSpot is a big cost on a monthly basis while other platforms are much less costly.,,
Being too complicate for the Sales Team to use on to go.,,
The hands on learning experience.,,
The way they have designed this is great.,,
Not sure how I like the new design.,,
The only thing I don't like about Hubspot is the costs.,,
"- the tool brings marketing and sales together
",,
The one downside I've found is the add on products.,,
"This package allows you to have three user logins, with a maximum of 100 contacts, but you are welcome to add to your network for an additional $100 per 1,000 contacts.",,
Sometimes I don't get clear answers to the problems I am facing so,,
"If you have a more complicated set up and like to run very customized reports and workflows, you will hit road blocks due to a lack of features or features that aren't thought through all the way.",,
For example editing navigation bar wasn't in a logical place for me.,,
I don't like that it can be glitchy sometimes.,UX:bugs,
"The alternative is to find a Hubspot Agency in your area to help you integrate, set up and use the platform - the big advantage is that they will get to know your business and your growth goals, challenges and gaps to ensure you make your investment drive 20 - 30% year on year growth.",,
"So far I have been able to replicate most functionality requests in the COS HubSpot sites, ask me a few years ago",,
"The landing page editors can be a bit clunky, and restricting at times.",,
"Other times, the email tracker will never work.",,
They have monetized it very well.,,
"What I dislike the most is that I can't post a bunch of pictures for each social media site, particularly LinkedIn and Instagram where I can only post one.",features:Actionable:wishes,
"For example, social analytics are on the social page, blog analytics on the blog page, etc.",,
That sometimes the images on an email sent does not render well (it happened yesterday) and I have to go back and send it again (in the middle of a meeting),bugs:Actionable,
The only thing I dislike is that you are unable to schedule a page update on a page that has changes while the previous version is still live.,,
There are also occasional glitches when scheduling social media posts that make it,,
"The email marketing, workflow set up, campaign management (essentially all marketing features) are not as easy as they what they sell to you.",,
Lead Scoring has been improved in the last year and has a little bit of a learning curve.,,

Reporting could be improved at enterprise level.,,
Very little i dislike.,,
There isn't much to dislike so far.,,
esta herramienta de los aspectos negativos.,,
I'd be more than willing to forego some email features in exchange for the ease of use.,,
"I think small businesses like ours could benefit from the next level, but we can't afford it.",,
"The interface took a bit of time to get used to, also, the font used on template emails is slightly different than googles font.",,
There are a few minor areas that could use improvement.,,
Many of the features.,,
"Some of the HTML email formats are not easy to manipulate for my liking, for example moving some of the blocks in the already made templates messes up the whole email and at that point it becomes difficult to do anything about it.",,
A way of shortlisting candidates for a data base (mapping them out).,,
Right now we're having issues with our automatic emails for when a blog posts.,,
"For one ti can be only used for Twitter, no other platforms, you can't choose the image for the post, etc.",,
"It is a quite costly software, one pays 200 dollars to get 100 contacts and an extra 100 dollars to have 1000 contacts.",,
The really good marketing tools are very expensive.,,
"In addition, new tools are always coming out to challenge Hubspot, which can provide additional service.",,
"I wish email and landing page templates were a little easier to design from scratch, but",,
Email templates and landing pages/,,
It tends to get too expensive once you start using it for all the features.,,
Some things seem to be unnecessarily complicated.,,
The unsubscribe pages could be a bit more versatile as well.,,
"Lack of freeze pains in goals, deals and anything else in board or table view.",,
"detail features need bigger ""audience"" to get implemented (e. g. delay for workflows), reporting can become complicated depending on where you start",,
"Unfortunately I don't have permission to make all of the amends that I want, however the support from HubSpot is excellent.",,
You enter a city URL and it comes up with the Sanitation Department.,,
"Personally, I am in an office as much as out of an office when I need to access my client’s data and having a more apt mobile app would be helpful.",,
"They seemed to have done a major revamp of their UI recently, which looks amazing.",,
"Reporting is still difficult for use to customize - our business model (freemium software) doesn't fit the traditional marketing/sales structure, so flexibility is lacking in that area.",,
Need improvements on this area.,,
The only thing about Hubspot we did not like was the on boarding process.,,
My only con if I had to choose one would be the lack of tips and tricks resources out there.,,
Additionally it produces much more information than needed making the excel difficult to use without cleaning it up first.,,
"In future releases/updates, there should be a way to create customized dashboards that can pull from any metric.",,
Another reason that I don’t like about the software is that its customer services is not so great.,,
"For example, you can easily organize forms and landing pages into folders, but workflows do not have a folder organization type feature.",,
"Even for the A/B testing tool in non-automated emails, there is no way to test time of day, so you have to run this manually as well.",,
Being new subjects,,
"Having functionality to build pages easily, like you can in LeadPages or ClickFunnels would bring Hubspot's game to a whole new level.",,
Like all CRMs there is not enough customization in terms of building what you want.,,
I wish the marketplace was a bit more robust.,,
You can't autopost videos.,,
"Landing pages made easy
",,
Occasional outages and a constantly rotating staff of support people.,,
the subscriptions are pricey and expensive,price,
It seems like sometimes I get lost in the vastness of the program.,UX,
Autosave in general has caused me a lot of trouble when doing HTML emails.,,
Design opportunities are limited when it comes to email creation.,,
I love HubSpot and use it nearly daily.,,
I wish the social part of the tool was a little more robust.,,
"Also, I wish they offered insights on what documents people open in emails.",features:wishes:Actionable,
"The software is very user friendly and forgiving with errors — whereas Pardot, our former marketing automation software, required a lot of redoing of work if the wrong template was used.",,
"Also, EDM campaigns do not show data for EDMs that haven't been viewed/clicked.",,
So you will need to have a separate software to be able to view accounts receivable report.,,
"Also, many a times the tool gets disconnected with gmail.",,
"The reporting functionality does not even mirror the richness that the ""List"" generating capabilities are, specifically allowing nested logic (Aka and/or statements).  ",,
"Their HubSpot Academy video training is very good, but customer help resources are disorganized and hard to find.",,
"Because there are so many pieces of data that can be connected to a contact, I'd love to have more insights into them and how to adjust for my companies needs.",,
"the search: searching for website pages can be difficult to find and make edit to unless you know the exact name of the post word for word. 
",,
Some functionality could be improved.,,
The email builder leaves A LOT to be desired.,,
There have been no downsides to using Hubspot.,,
That there is no easy way to demote contacts from a lifecycle stage,,
so I don't have to leave the site and grab them from my notes.,,
The social monitoring tools are not the most ideal.,,
They are very helpful and have great support though.,,
Poor organization abilities within Files and Templates - Files.,,
"Second, results may vary with landing page creation and integration with your site.",integrations,
The structure of the software programs is possibly the one thing that's a little bit problematic.,,
I miss the feature where I could see where an email was opened.,,
"The platform can be a bit glitchy at times; for example, I've had trouble from time to time updating contact lists or changing email modules.",,
"There are some limitations for what we can publish, largely due to the native tools themselves.",,
"before that scheduled call.
",,
I would like to see a better way to prepopulate contacts before they in the Hubspot system.,,
I dislike some of the interface because it can be a pain to figure out how to use some of the features or find some of my entries.,,
so it's been a transition.,,
This means you are limited still by some quirks in the system.,,
I wish they would just download straight from the engine.,,
"The platform, while it's easy to customize within the bounds of the platform, has difficulty with customization.",,
How it's hard to export contact lists and it's not straight forward.,,
"They fixed the confusing pricing (that regularly changes), so that's better.",price,
"Our team doesn't have the need for all of the features on the platform (such as Sales and Conversations), so it sometimes feels like we are wasting money.",,
You can set communications at various stages of sales cycle and nurture your leads into paying customer.,,
The pricing is high for SAAS based companies.,price,
"The SEO stuff I feel like I don't get my moneys worth,",,
I’m actually surprised this option has never been integrated in a software like this one.,,
The SEO modules of this software are basic and only assistive.,,
"It's also challenging to determine accurate measurements (sessions, website analytics) when using HubSpot as they measure differently.",,
To get the best out of hubspot I feel you need hubspot sales as well and that can easily double the cost,,
That I can't wave my magic wand and know how to do all-the-things right now!,,
Sometimes you feel as if you've just mastered something and then Hubspot will change it without warning.,,
Little things like not being able to upload a video and have it auto-play on Twitter or being able to do a unquoted retweet at a scheduled time is an issue for us.,,
"Prior to the full implementation of HubSpot in our organization, I was having to manage the visualization of our sales strategy in Excel.  ",,
It is primarily an inbound marketing platform and as such the system has been designed around this format.,,
It would be nice if the API allowed more calls based on our in-house identifiers rather than having to store IDs in our system in order to make calls in the other direction.,,
"In the sales tool, you can add products, but I can not utilize those products as properties, within workflows, deals, etc.",,
Would be great to get more granular with website traffic tracking.,,
"You are not able to post video, carousels, or stories using the publisher. 
",Actionable:features:wishes,
I often find myself using zapier to transfer information to outside sources because hubspot restricted structured data import practices.,,
"If you decide to go with the full suite of products, it can be very expensive.",,
I would prefer that Hubspot provide us a better initial understanding of the free aspects of the service vs the paid plans up front.,,
That will be a welcome addition.,,
"Our IT team creates a lot of custom APIs for integrations and that is great but if a smaller team didn't have this bandwith, it might be extra limited.",,
There are a few gaps between this and Google Analytics and my CRM.,,
"There is a lot to learn within HubSpot, depending on what features you use.",,
"- Everything you need is under one roof -- blogging, landing pages, call to action buttons, CRM, social media posting and monitoring, competitor tracking, and so much more
",,
The only reason I gave a 9 for recommendation is that it force logs out often and,,
There is a significant learning curve for anyone unfamiliar with customer relationship management tools.,,
"Again, for what MOST people use the platform for, it does the job.",,
"For me, it is just obvious that it is the same company name under which I create a new contact.",,
I know many coders who hate HubSpot for that reason.,,
"- Ability to track all sorts of performance metrics, from email marketing to CTA clicks",,
"and is definitely behind the curve when it comes to any sort of advanced customization of your CRM (ie. non-admin's can add/remove company-wide integrations and view all company dashboards, no basic function to customize exactly what new team members see on records)",,
"I really would not have any problem with the software in general, it would only be a small opinion about the language, some sections are completely in English and this is usually a hindrance for those who do not handle much the language, but in general Hobspot is a complete software and any doubt that being present is solved with the help of support.",,
"Also, the analytics tool is limited so you still need to configure Google Analytics if you need more insights.",,
However that was years ago so this may have resolved itself.,,
It is costly to upgrade and really hard to separate permissions.,,
There are a few frustrating lapses in HubSpot's platform.,,
"But if you need any type of filtered info like ""emails sent to list x last week"", you're going to have to manually export that data because there's no way to do it in HubSpot.",,
"Overall, hubspot reporting can improve.",,
Things not saving or reverting back to earlier versions.,bugs,
"This is a like and a dislike at the same time because there are so many of them, that it’s hard to understand them all in a short time.",,

The only thing I had an objection to were the training modules.,,

Hubspot's lacks a bit of flexibility when it comes to styling forms.,,
There is nothing I really dislike about HubSpot Marketing.,,

There is always someone willing to help!,support:UX,
Bounces.,,
"Also, the marketing emails sometimes get caught in junk boxes and you have to add a footer for the company address which I don’t like having.",,
When a workflow gets large they can become very unwieldy.,,
I don't think their CRM is as up-to-date as many of their competitors.,,
Although it may not be a huge feature even the smallest ones affect sales on their day to day.,,
"The main issue we've had, in marketing, with HubSpot is getting our emails to render correctly in Outlook.",,
And there is a big difference between a hard and a soft bounce.,,
The current analytics is to high level but gives us what we need for now.,,
"Clicking into a company or a deal from a contact usually means once you're done there, you start back at zero.",,
I would say there's somewhat of a learning curve in the beginning if you've never used it.,,
The fuller package is very expensive and only reserved for larger companies.,,
We have two distinct industries in our target audience.,,
", I know they're probably busy and sometimes my issues are highly technical, but I just want to make sure they haven't forgotten about me.",,
"They are pretty flexible with discounts for prepaying, and they throw in some bonus contacts usually.",,
"Also, Hubspot's Lists and the And/Or filters are a little complicated (but maybe that's just me).",,
I also receive way too many emails from Hubspot.,,
It would be helpful if the marketing initiated emails were also flagged to sales as opens and clicks occur - they find that very helpful.,,
The only thing I would say I dislike is the fact that there are so many different things to learn when using hubspot.,,
Confusing pricing scheme and average customer service.,,
"One of the disadvantages present in HubSpot is the continuously updated platform, which implies a deterioration or a labor delay with respect to the increase in digital marketing in the market.",,
but I find it to be annoying.,,
I feel it is very open.,,
"It is a little bit pricey to get extra features, but manageable",,
It's hella expensive to keep your website on HubSpot and would be a pain to take it off of HubSpot.,,
HubSpot can get glitchy..,,
This will come off more like a back-handed compliment but there is not a lot to dislike.,,
And the email open-tracking software isn't 100% accurate (but mostly accurate).,features,
I don't like how it's difficult to view paid search results specifically on the platform.,,

Sometimes I am hindered in email marketing due to your rules.,,
"I wish there was some way that I could get emails/text alerts about the most important things, but not everything that people are taking note of.",,
I dislike that Hubspot puts extra code in emails.,,
"Faltam algumas funcionalidades adicionais na versão gratuita, como produtos, penso que isso deixaria muito mais fácil",,
"While the UI is very intuitive and easy to use, they tend to roll out UI changes piecemeal and in weird ways.",,
"I don't think it is about disliking, but it takes a lot of time to get through all of the features.",,
I'm sure if we took the time to watch all of the HubSpot videos we could have done it ourselves,,
"We spent hours trying to work with customer service and support to fix issues, send emails, and overall just use the platform, and we were never given any help.",,
Some of it doesn't apply to me.,,
"It's a very broad software, so there are no industry specific components.",,
I don't see a way to see metrics on each piece of content.,,
Their integrations need some work.,,
They seem to think its ok to make users touch EACH and EVERY form on their website to block a new domain.,,

The scroll to the left and right should always be accessible and you shouldn't have to scroll to the bottom of the page to get it to it.,UX:Actionable,
The fact that you have to pay so much more for every little add-on.,,

The Email window is a little clunky.,,

"There are workarounds, but they take time to set up and have major flaws.",,
"You're still at the mercy of sales to enter and track their data accurately, a downfall of all marketing/sales systems.",,
I'm not a fan of the glitchiness per say.,,

"The only thing I can think of as a dislike is the pricing on the marketing software - for a small business that needs more than the free program, but is not yet ready to make such a large financial commitment, there isn't an intermediate step that makes sense for a small business.",,
Also the fact if you post to social media with videos they don't autoplay so sadly diminishes the ease of the social published.,,

it's design as well.,,
There are times when I find it hard to find exactly what I'm looking for quickly,,
"But overall, quite happy with the adoption.",,
"The email template builder and design manager can be somewhat confusing, and are more time-consuming than I would prefer.",,
"Even if we repost the same content, the link is re-shortened which burns through our quota of custom Bitly links each month), landing page builder is obtuse and extraordinarily difficult to customize",,
Not all posts have a preview image.,,
They do run the freemium model so once you see more goodies you want to use it will start to cost you a lot fast.,,
"I struggled with the page caching the content (stylesheet), so I had to flush the DNS, everytime I change the stylesheet.",UX:bugs:Actionable,
BUT they also need to be verified in order to send a test email.,,
but when we switched to Salesloft we found that the analytics on SalesLoft were much better for management.,,
"While easy to navigate, the changing of names can make it difficult to find what you're looking for.",,
"It's also very expensive software, so you need to make sure it's the right fit",,
I wish the SEO features were a little clearer and easier to use.,,
Required a lot of coding knowledge.,,
"After a few hours of use, the app seems to start to slow down.",,
I get why they are sunsetting basic...,,
"This would be HUGE to help us better automate, manage, and develop persona specific product workflows.",,
I'd like to be able to easily hand their program over to them if they decide to go in another direction or graduate to hiring an in-house marketing person to handle their social media needs.,,
"It's extremely user-friendly, even for my clients who have no idea what they're doing.",,
Free accounts are getting less and less features.,,
"Their web hosting service can be extremely complex, and you can expect to spend many hours on the phone with customer service while you were learning the platform.",,
It is not integrated with some other softwares that we use (i.e. loyalty programs),,
For example I can't use HTML banners created in Bannersnack.,,
HubSpot is incredibly expensive And often times they require yearly contracts.,,
"Everyone you talk to is highly siloed and cannot answer any questions even the slightest step outside of their ""expertise.",,
There is a lot of information and programs that are being offered and at first it can all be very overwhelming.,,
"We have the Marketing Hub, which makes doing anything with payment difficult.",,
At first the learning curve of how different areas are connected to each other can be high.,support:UX,
There's not too much i dislike.,,
The A/B testing cannot be implied on automated emails sequence.,,
The reports feature.,,
It takes me hours to create simple landing pages that reflect our branding because of the landing page editor's shortcomings.,,
"There are some minor user experience things (wish there was better functionality for tickets/conversations) that could be solved, but overall it's a great product.",,
"Then, connecting the flow of information from the CRM to HubSpot is always a challenge.",,
Such as more detail on traffic and views.,,
"Hubl is not as easy to understand at first, and even if there are many modules, there could be even more -and creating them requires understanding of logic.",,
Doesn't really support scaling over 100k contacts.,,
I turned them all off but not before I was super stressed by the volume of shouting reminders I was receiving!,,
"It's hard to pick a fault with hubspot, other than minor tweaks that will probably be changed over time.",,
"Once I figured out where everything was, a few things changed again.",UX:updates:bugs,
Doesn't seem to like integration to Salesforce that well.,,
Second thing - there's no direct integration with Intercom.,,
"Whenever I want to post a video to Instagram, I have to use my phone.",,
so it took a 3rd party team to help implement the setup.,,
"With any social media tool, there are issues with compatibility.",,
"Very easy to mistakenly move deals around in the sales admin, potentially triggering all of our automation.",,
Some processes could be streamlined a little more.,,
"You're not able to do any A/B testing on workflow emails unless you set it up manually, which is a huge downside.",,
"When merging contact records, it doesn't merge the email lists that the contacts are apart of, so either that has to be done manually, or that information is lost, which is bad for email marketing.",,
"Some of their lead qualifying is very questionable, and basically all their forms look atrocious (they're just simple javascript on the page) .",,
Often we need support from a developer for setting up pages like we would.,,
I go to other tools for help due to the issues.,,
"The testing can be difficult, however, it's definitely worth your time/taking notes.",,
I also do not like that they got ride of the keywords tools and do not like the pillar content building tools.,,
"There are some issues that can be addressed - mostly, they regard the interaction with SalesForce - but HS team is always supporting when it comes to finding solutions",,
They aren't transparent about the quality of their servers they use for shared hosting making it difficult to address TTFB issues.,,
How hard it is to accomplish seemingly easy tasks.,,
The only complaint I have is that the CRM is not as full-featured as we've needed.,,
They only thing I wish they didn't do is take away the keyword expolrer.,,
"With many changes, sometimes things break.  ",,
I would love to see more social media options available to extend the reach beyond the usual Facebook or Twitter.,,
"Nothing really, it would just be good to have more time to discover what else it can do to help.",,
Some of the filters don't work the best.,,
Making changes (especially for SEO) within the templates is difficult and not as intuitive as I would like.,integrations:UX:Actionable,
"I don't like that you can't delete a post, only put into a draft.",,
"I am a huge fan, only wish we could build out more",,
This should be integrated more.,,
"A more evolved tutorial is needed for the use, possibly some functions that may help to drive the software are unattainable because of the lack of understanding when using them.",,
"Also, I wanted more from their social reporting, but a new beta just came out addressing some of those needs.",,
"The different pieces are really siloed, so it's hard to have everything that's in a campaign just be visible in one spot.",,
"Also, they charge extra for anything you want to add above and beyond the basic plans.",,
"When I go to make changes on my website, I'd love the ability to click directly within the layout to open up the editor, but sometimes it takes a few clicks to get exactly to the block I need to edit.",,
""" I often get bounced around multiple times until I land on the person who can actually answer my question.",Actionable:bugs:support,
"If you're interested in outbound marketing, this is not the tool for you.",,
Their email builder and landing page builder are woefully behind their competitors.,,
Will update this review if I do.,,
"However, they're making efforts to improve those aspects.",,
Some of the customisation options and design editors can be a bit laborious.,,
"There is certainly a learning curve, but once you figure it out it is easy to use.",,
"I found myself being so surprised by all of the features that when something wouldn't work out exactly like I thought it should, I would be shocked.",,
Hubspot's greatest area of improvement is in its dashboards.,,
interface can be difficult to navigate.,,
As a product HubSpot is still maturing and there are significant changes as well as many Beta products that have existed for 1+ years.,price:updates,
We are a news organization with stories going live 24/7-365.,,
"When I need help, it's nearly impossible to get someone to answer me.",,
"They don't provide any option to take website back-up.

"To access different features for one webpage, I may have to access up to four different drop-down areas as each function is siloed.",,
"That will help to have everything well organized, and save a lot of time working on it.",,
"It is a pretty complicated platform, you have to know how to use it and most of the time I feel like I am paying for a lot but not using it to the fullest potential.",,
"I think what would catapult HubSpot to absolute perfection is the capability of creating completely separate autonomous databases for even greater flexibility when needed, even with a limited number of databases allowed per account.  ",,
I just need to wait a day and the issue is fixed.,bugs:support,
We previously used another online chat tool and found it was much more capable of handling our chat traffic and was easier for operators to use.,,
If that were gone this platform would be almost perfect.,,
"It can be really difficult to use with our really long sales cycle, but I think this would be the same with any software.",,
You have to be really good at coding and have the time to watch all the tutorials.,,
su tiempo adaptarse,,
"‘Rank’, ‘monthly searches’, ‘difficulty’, and ‘CPC’ are very helpful because they help my team",,
This seems backwards to how we want to leverage the tool.,,
"After you have used this tool for over a year, you do not really hear from the Customer Success team unless you reach out to them.",,
I disliked that I already have a crm account with another company and hubspot just can't let it go.,,
"For instance, if I directly post a square size image on LinkedIn, it will show the image in the Max size, but though Hubspot the image is contained in rectangular frame.",,
"For a while, I was disappointed that I couldn't pick my target dates in the workflow from a calendar, but Hubspot finally listened and add a calendar!",,
The same is true for contact records.,,
I tried to share different formats to see what works best for my audience,,
HubSpot is nothing like Oracle's Eloqua.,,
Only other issue I experience is within chrome a contact or company record page will not fully populate.,,
"While Hubspot works to perfection of working with us to suit our one of a kind circumstance and number of brands, there are times that we experience issues with how it communicates with our other programming, for example, Salesforce.",,
"Hubspot is a pretty easy platform to use and offers great perks, but I sometimes questioned how far it could take the league?",,
sure there is a lot more we could do.,,
"Campaign progress needs work, big time.",,
The interface is somewhat difficult for a marketer to use.,,
There is also a % completed checklist that is incredibly annoying as a rep because the sequence of things we did were different than the sequence hubspot had set up.,support:Actionable:UX,
"Some times the add crash on the outllook, and we neet to repeat the login",,
It would be great to have an hour with a rep each month with the prof marketing package to help guide you as you go.,,
so it's hard to understand.,,
When a contact leaves the company and starts or joins another one there is a little hassle to manage that as well as the registration process.,,
"It takes a quite a while to learn, because it is so comprehensive.",,
HubSpot's landing page template editor is a mixed bag.,,
I have found it difficult to format blogs in the exact order or place photos in the format I would prefer.,,
"That means I have to use other tools to complement this necessity, but, above all things, Hubspot is a super nice tool.",,
"The reporting with Salesforce could be way better, the support isn't as good as it use to be, I wish you could A/B test emails with workflows.",,
It's incredibly pricy.,,
"It isn't an issue with global editing features, but with some bugs in the system.",,
"Another ""issue"" is how frequently the product is updated",,
Sometimes it is a little hard to track down which workflow is initiating which action.,,
"It does not perform auditing, nor is it integrated into the google analytics platform.",wishes:integrations,
Sometimes a workflow will affects thousands of records so it is impossible to click into each profile/record to see if that particular individual should in fact be affected by the workflow OR if you need to go back and make tweaks before turning the automation on.,,
There are a few glitches here and there within HubSpot,,
"To the best of my understanding, this feature is not yet available.",,
"If our team ever stumbles across something we dislike about Hubspot, we reach out to our support team and they are always quick to respond.",,
Also there are no quick demos for what you should be doing or setting up on your account.,,
I think I dislike that when you have to windows open on your computer and each take up half the screen the tabs suddenly dissappear,,
I think our biggest dislike right now would be that HubSpot is overly expensive.,,
I’ve found template code issues and after reaching out to the provider I never heard back.,,
"In my opinion some areas of reporting features are more comprehensive than others, but on the other side, they constantly provide new updates and work on product’s improvement.  ",,
"Though, I’m not sure how it could be improved upon-",,
Id rather have a month to month plan and be able to cancel or skip months.,,
"Also, the reporting system is a nightmare.",,
"Some configuration instructions are not on the HubSpot page, it would be wonderful if you could add some extra tutorials to configure the tools a little faster.",,
The quality of voice is sometimes unclear to hear because of the slow internet connection.,,
Sometimes when I click on an email it notifies me that I have someone opening it.,,
"I got my moneys worth out of the more advanced plan.
",,
I wish there were more automated reporting options — some of the reporting elements are a little ambiguous.,wishes:features:Actionable,
Some of them are a tad confusing.,,
I should be able to publish workflows even if all the collateral materials have not been built yet; especially if I have delays built in to the flow.,,
"This is moreover like a suggestion, They have limited features on Conversion Rate Optimization, if they introduce heat maps, scrolling patterns, etc, that'll be super awesome.",,
I also value the support and the educational content that HubSpot provides.,,
"With mobile being such a big platform, there needs to be more flexibility there.",,
"Again, I primarily use HubSpot for its social media scheduling capabilities.",,
"When I used it, we were able to send emails directly from the HS site, but once someone responded to the email, that response never showed up on site.",,
Actually nothing...,,
We were short-sold on its integration capabilities.,,
It's more for direct and consumer sales.,,
The website editor is a bit wonky and more difficult to use unless you're doing the most basic functions like editing text.,,
I find this can make me less efficient and I spend more time retyping emails that I use a similar word track for.,,
We are not able to use this tool with the ads from instagram.,,
and I'm hoping that gets fixed.,,
Too much information needed to make it fully work,,
I don't like that we are missing a CRM tool that is HIPPA compliant.,,
Having a tagging system gives you the vital insights into what a contact or company is doing with your business in an instant without having to scroll through the record.,,
I know we have frequent issues with internal emails bouncing.,bugs:Actionable,
"There are also many features we would use in marketing like surveys, but they are not only included with other parts of the suite like service.",,
"I know that this should be in the development section, but in my opinion, there must be more people eager to have some kind of this function.",,
It’s not as user friendly as Salesforce might be.,,
Also the web chat is limited compared to other chat vendors,,
"I wish you could tag individuals for LinkedIn posts, and not just companies to tag.",,
From physical location to social media urls.,,
"Plus, you'll also notice an increase in engagement if you do.",,
it is little bit expencive.,,
We have decided to use another service to receive analytics for individual posts.,,
"However, we have found that the API/servers aren't responsive enough for us to use them in our sign up flow, which is really fast.",,
"pro para un par de ellas, dificulta que las personas que van iniciando puedan obtener los conocimientos completos.",,
"The only thing I HAD disliked was that there was no integration with Outlook for Mac, but that has changed as of today!",,
Now it looks nicer but the ability to edit the rule is gone.,,
"It is very pricey, and there are so many features it can be a little overwhelming at first.",,
Developers are a little expensive to higher for a tiny issue.,price,
HubSpot's build-in analytics are pretty basic.,,
The sizing and scrolling within that window is touchy.,,
"Very little - some UI issues that make some things difficult to find, but you get used to it.",,
I know that the repressive is working hard to help us solve our issue,,
Drag and drop are not always the most ideal and the zoom integration lacks some specifications,,
"Would like more analytics tools, though they are adding more and improving some.",,
The cost was a bit high for us,,
"Although, if you lack coding knowledge, you may find yourself having trouble implementing certain changes if you choose to use HubSpot to host your website.",,
"Nevertheless, definitely no deal breakers in there.",,
"If you are really in a hurry, it's better to just call.",,
The UX/UI of Hubspot leaves a lot to be desired.,,
"The only thing I dislike about Hubspot is that the workflows, which are so important, can be confusing to build.",,
"but now I'm scheduling my daily tasks and reminders to write a new blog or send an email to a certain segment of customers.
",,
"In addition, I usually like to make a webpage and release it to the public.  ",,
"Having a free trial that includes all features (rather than the ones from the package you're choosing) is frustrating, because it's not always clear which features are premium/enterprise level.",,
"How easy becomes manage your webpage using the landing page tool, the result appears immediately.
",,
I'd be better to have the option to create a template from scratch because sometimes the ready-made templates don't quite match with what we want and editing/customising the modules can be a bit tricky.,,
"The simplicity of everything down from the custom reporting, right down to the deal pipelines give a great user experience.",,
The price of the product and the limitations on the free version.,,
"Year 2 is a different story, once they have you locked in.",,
Some support members are less experienced than others but if that's the situation any case will get escalated properly.,,
It could have saved me a few seconds.,,
"There's too much to manage, From developing your personas, to creating content calendars, to finding time to write your blog — it's a lot of work.",,
There are very few things I dislike about HubSpot.,,
"I don't like that it gives the social media manager full control over an organization's social media program and contacts, to where they are reliant on the SMM.",,
"VERY VERY laggy 
",,
There are always things that you can dislike about a product.,,
An automatic downsize feature to the proper size for use with social media would be amazing.,,
"If I send an email to 50 people, it will often let me know that ""xx number of people have opened your email"", but rarely lets me know which email addresses have opened that email (I experience this problem most often with large group emails).",,
It is not always cost-effective for our clients.,,
The one thing I wish HubSpot would add to their ads tool is better reporting.,,
My favorite one is when other contacts information will accidentally get mixed up in another leads profile.,,
Landing page templates are a bit restrictive.,,
"There isn't much that I dislike about HubSpot, but I would say that it would be best to be able to pin any task to the top of the page instead of only making it notes that can be pinned.",,
"Adds on through HubSpot are expensive, some clients do not want to pay out for these extras.",,
You can spend a lot of time jumping around between modules and tools with a fair amount of mental gymnastics in play to keep everything organized.,,
"The functionality of it is hard to work with at times, but still gets the job done and does what we need it to.",,
"I am not in Marketing, so I am sometimes a bit confused with some of the functionalities.",,
"However, I have noticed an issue with the contact function that does not facilitate the inclusion of more than one email address.",Actionable:bugs:features,
So if I do an album I have to do it manually.,,
For example social is only status updates.,,
It's pretty expensive...,,
Organizing uploaded files could be easier.,,
GIFs don’t work on Facebook when you post them through Hubspot.,,
"For instance, on the analytics, it would be very helpful to be able to see time frame over time frame, just like you would in Google Analytics.",,
The WYSIWYG cannot really be trusted and I have to spend an awful lot of time in html to get the content how I would like.,,
but then it was helpful,,
I wish that the Comments threads would expand be able to comment on.,,
It gets annoying when you're working on a massive piece of work that you can't save.,,
I wish there was a way to automate social media posting from a library of items.,,
Groupings need to be made by lists instead of being able to do so in the graph tools.,,
This feature is very limited and has only the basic information.,,
Patience is a virtue and HubSpot has eliminated most of the waiting ...,,
"If there's a way to link HubSpot and YouTube, as well, that would help us, too.",,
How much they charge to get access to those tools.,,
It was expensive and the automations were a little difficult with regards to formatting/design issues,,
It would be better to have a CTA or an email etc to show users where they can get training resources on their first login.,,
I can't keep up with the software changes.,,
Also they are changing some designs which has made it a little more complicated.,,
"For most of my clients, HubSpot is expensive and it can be difficult to ""sell"" them on the platform.",,
The important thing was that none of our data was compromised and the website was still live for prospects to view.,,
"I can confirm that their support service team is excellent, you can call, chat or email them to submit a ticket.",,
The only complaint I can think of is that sometimes certain areas of the interface change without notifying you first.,,
Only the very basic.,,
"Conversely, our on-boarding rep emailed an employee, not the manager, that our scheduled call was going to be rescheduled due to not all of our team being able to make the call -- which was news to us.",,
Or maybe you could make it more custom per user.,,
"If I can receive specific open notifications for one-off or small group emails, why can I not for larger ones?",,
"Because I use multiple instances, there seems to be an inconsistency between some of the roll outs.",,
The layout could be much simpler and cleaner.,,
"Because there is no fail-over/redundancy with the chatbot, it just gets stuck in a loop until the user actually answers the initial question.",UX:Actionable:bugs:support,
SO HubSpot has these video modules on which you can't automatically encode subtitles like YouTube.,,
"A few things like connections for the domains and intergrations werent smooth, although that was probably usre error. 
",,
It is not designed well for international companies who have multiple currencies and special needs for access right.,,
I wish the was an opportunity to extract social media reports.,Actionable:wishes:features,
The actual reporting tool is a little harder to use and optimize.,,
When using Hubspot for email be aware that they will not send emails to anyone who has hard bounced from anyone in their database.,,
They really are working towards a better product even when they already have a great one.,,
I feel like a need an extensive training on how to use it all.,,
There is nothing I really dislike in Hubspot.,,
The price is quite high if you are not making much profit from the benefit of using the tool.,,
Pitiful support on my Samsung phone.,,
"Hang ups when there are updates to the platform, email sends can process for quite a while, list building is a lot more complex and time consuming since the update of processing while building, limited campaign data, limited hubly data, report building is limited, lead score page needs a revamp - very slow and way too long when you have a lead score model in place, templates and design manager is a challenge",,
Ask lots of questions before you pick them.,,
"Because I integrate it with Salesforce, I wonder if Pardot's integration is better.",,
"While it is easy to use it also doesn't allow for much ""out of the box"" designing for things such as emails.",,
"There are many in-depth support resources, but it can be frustrating when trying to make a seemingly small template change involves a long, complicated process.",,
"Every day additional function requirements are restricted verses available to all personal users, and not be restricted to budget limits.",,
I disliked the quizzes.,UX:Actionable,
The design tools in HubSpot are not as robust as other parts of the platform.,,
"File management could be improved - functionality such as cloning folders etc, as well as positively encouraging users to upload assets into folders, rather than loosely at the root level.",,
HubSpot has some weird quirks you have to work around.,,
"So anytime we have a post that includes a few photos, we have to do it through Facebook and the analytics don't get synced with HubSpot.",,
"Depending on who you get on the support team, you may or may not have your questions answered correctly.",,
Migrating all of our forms from Marketo has been challenging to do on our own.,,
"No phone support for CRM free level, so when I've had issues I've had to go through a thousand emails to get a simple question answered.",,
its also a difficult platform to jump in to on your own without taking an introductory class.,,
There are too many fields in some cases.,,
I would love to see video integration for social media platforms.,Actionable:wishes:features,
"Example: Someone tells me they are ready to schedule an appointment, but not in front of their calendar so cb tomorrow morning at 8:30; there is no way to indicate that this callback is ""hot"" and customer asking for call back at specific time.",,
"Sometimes it could be a little confusing if you do not have ""super admin"" access to all of the tools.",,
I would like to see more improvements to the email platform.,,
Sometimes there is a delay in desktop notifications on the email opens and for website visitors.,,
"HubSpot is not much advanced yet for latest generation of marketing and sales, because it's complicated to use for first time so it should be updated for best in business of marketing.",,
We are unable to have a custom sales dashboard with the fields that we feel are the most efficient to us.,,
I wish it was easier for their team to make a custom email template.,,
I do wish that exporting/importing contacts was a little easier.,,
"It can be a little tricky to navigate as the dashboard really can get cluttered, but after you learn you'll love it.",,
Having graded assignments can be a double edged sword sometimes.,,
Everything about the way this product is about upselling.,,
"To be able to say you want to filter by criteria ((1 and 2) and (3 or 4)), you have to say (1 and 2 and 3) or (1 and 2 and 4).",,
One thing I wish was different was re-naming campaigns and re-naming folders.,,
"For example, it would be great to access ""Calculated Properties"" or ""Sales Playbooks"" without having to upgrade to the Enterprise package.",,
I believe they are working on solving this though!,,
"Salespeople could only see a particular prospect's status, web interactions and downloads when they clicked on and reviewed that prospect's file--which only works for prospects that a rep is actively engaged with.",,
"Merging them together is possible, but it never seems to merge together properly, so when you search for one thing, instead of getting the whole set, you get just a portion.",,
"While we have been able to tweak some features for donor management purposes, there are still a lot of features that need to be adapted.",,
"so you have to relearn the system, and analytics take a little longer to show up than other analytics systems",,
Or at least have desktop notifications.,,
"For example, an embedded video can display correctly in the preview, but have its dimensions radically altered when published to the live site.",,
"There is a cropping option, but no resize option.  ",,
"I greatly disliked the fact that in order to use many of the marketing automation features of Hubspot, the web pages needed to be Hubspot pages, not assets within a web page.  ",,
"It can be a challenge to stay abreast of the updates, and you'll want to stay up to date on your training.  ",,
I wish I could select multiple ad sources / results and display them in one spot for comparison -- or tag them as related to each other to display the same data comparison.,,
Pay monthly for the reporting module.,,
Unless you are doing your reporting inside of HubSpot pulling all the data can be a very manual process that takes way more time than it should.,,
"HubSpot may turn some people off because of the price, but it is definitely worth the investment.",,
Some of the functions don't necessarily work as you would think.,UX,
Some of the reporting for each individual social channel isn’t always up to date or 100% accurate.,,
"We can only share classic formats (video, photos, text).",,
The two natively integrate so that is at least one easy way to get away from HubSpot's CRM admin woes.,,
"Most of those I recommend this tool to, are looking for that",,
FORMS!,,
There isn't too much I dislike about hubspot.,,
I wish some of the analytics were a little more in depth.,,
Most of the times the user that is trying to use the form doesn't know how to use html/css to edit the style but it needs to make the form to blend with the company branding style.,,
Feels a bit clunky and old school compared to the competition.,,
"This is not a problem with the platform, rather an indication that you must be ready to put in the work.",,
Hubspot has many tools to learn so it is difficult to learn everything at once.,,
Limitations in buget and proposals.,,
"there's nothing really that I dislike about Hubspot, they change the layout frequently so that takes some getting used to",,
"Hubspot can tell you when a contact opened an email in it's contact history, but for some reason can't aggregate all that data into an email report.",,
"-super helpful support team when questions do arise
",,
"sometimes it says ""not on any hubspot pages"" - but it really is - just embedded in a different way than what the system recognizes.",,
"But, I am not sure if I can deploy this for larger corporates.",,
"One of the things I dislike about HubSpot is the formatting toolbox, specifically in blogs and on landing pages.",,
"Not amazing, not awful.",,
It's designed to be an all-in-one tool,,
"And, the 12-month contract thing kind of sucks.",,
I wish there was a dashboard/report for number of content downloads.,,
but it never hurts to learn something new,,
The main issue I have is that the HubSpot team seems to constantly be changing the navigation of the platform.,,
Their email builder tool is not as good as it could be.,,
Their SEO tools tend to be a bit lacking and I typically use other tools for that purpose.,,
The integrations aren't very seamless.,,
"The learning curve was a little high to learn Hubl, but I'd rather it was advanced and powerful, like it is, than if you had made it simple.",UX,
There is no option at all to view the performance of personalized body content.,,
The system has been updated quite frequently this year and the updates were very big changes.,,
I wanted a video to be playing across the page and they couldn't make it look right,,
"We have also been having trouble when clients unsubscribe and then want to subscribe again, they are unable to receive the emails as it now knows that they previously unsubscribed.",Actionable:bugs:features,
I don't like the more advanced template features and more sophisticated offerings.,,
One big issue I have is that currently there isn't a way to pull all the workflow performance data out of HubSpot to be easily formatted in an excel spreadsheet.,,
Workflows...,,
"Only then to realize you need to make calls-to-action, landing pages, content downloads, workflows, lead scoring and more.",,
"We thought we were getting a great deal (paid a monthly fee), but we needed many additional features and needed to expand our contact database - and both of those things meant lots more money.",,
If that is taken care of then this software is a masterpiece.,,
"It is hard to find important files using a search engine, and also replacing the files and attaching them to the message.",,
"I wish I wasn't limited on the number of custom report cards I could create. 
",,
"So far, there's nothing that I dislike about HubSpot.",,
"There's really nothing I dislike about HubSpot, though I would love to see them add some more insights on SEO and analytics",,

I don't like that you have to pay extra for the meetings functionality to work with your sales team.,,
I didn't like how I would manually have to start and stop whether hubspot tracked my emails.,,
"Being a rather savvy user, most of the times I ran into a dead end resulted in reached out to support just to find out that a certain thing is either not possible, or I had to find a solution / workaround on my end.",,

I wish the flow of the email history was a little more clear.,,

Support for @2x ('retina' or 'hi-res') images is questionable.,,

The only downside is when it comes to reporting.,,

"Moving from SurveyMonkey to HubSpot for emails was shocking, as trying to build and modify emails in HubSpot is such a pain.",,
"We've had clients asking us to train them, and it would be nice if HubSpot provided more resources in this area.",,

Sometimes the speed can be slow,,
I've been recently been using HubSpot's integration tool with LinkedIn Sales Navigator.,integrations,

More useful features could be added to the A/B page testing tool.,,
That is not possible to add videos on the Instagram channel through hubspot..,,

"When creating landing pages and emails, the boxes that highlight each module can get confusing and make it difficult to edit text.",,
"I don't know, just i'm learning to use all oportunities",,
Sometimes classes can be quite lengthy.,,
There are times that we were speaking with our customers and the line becomes fragmentary due to poor connection since this is internet based tool.,,
Some tools are newer than others and there are still features waiting to be added.,,
"I understand that not all aspects of the platform are developed at the same pace, but because uploading articles and creating landing pages are two major parts of my job, I get frustrated with them often.",,
Learning curve for most people is 2-3 months.,,
So when we do this we have to go directly to those platforms which means that we do not have records or data to show how that post did within Hubspot.,,
Sometimes some of the social media analytics are not accurate,,
It never entirely hindered our ability to work but sometimes it was frustrating.,,
I really miss having an individual customer success manager.,,
"so he can either point us in the direction of a tool we may have missed, or submit our feedback to the team for consideration of new features.",,
For that reason we actually use both HubSpot and google analytics.,,

What I dislike is the Design tools.,,
I find myself using lists to report on certain metrics that I believe should be easily visualized on their reporting dashboard.,,
"Sometimes UI is too simplified and overthinked - I would like to have some functionality and buttons available right on the page, instead of looking for it in a hidden panes.",,
Originally our workflows were too complicated to actually fit into our marketing operations.,,
There are times where the reports dashboard can get a little confusing but that just takes time.,,
Sometimes there are glitches with emails.,,
Some of the tools for building pages can be a little less than intuitive.,,
"Hubspot force you to a 12 month contract per agent with the perk, so at one moment I had 4 sales agents at my startup, now I'm forced to keep paying the four seats the whole year.

I feel like using 3 purpose built tools that are all simple and do their job well is a better approach.,,
It at times can be overkill or too expensive for smaller operations.,,
"Occasionally it posts to the wrong channels, so the company has over 20 channels in total, and even if I schedule it for one it particular, it might do it for a different one.",,
Sometimes it can be a little slow if there is a large volume of data involved.,,
There is nothing I really dislike about this software,,

There are lots of menu options and it's not 100% clear where to go for everything.,,
"Overall this is an improvement from how we managed sales and contacts before, but the email system is not user friendly or as effortless as Mailchimp, which we used before.",,
They know that they are the gold standard so they don’t mind increasing rates on startups.,,
"HubSpot uses its own coding language (HUBL), which requires hiring a HubSpot developer for most features and functionality that would otherwise not require outsourced development.",,
One thing we've moved away from is using HubSpot as our blog.,,

Lot's of small bugs occur that prolong my work sometimes.,,
It's not uncommon when editing an email or landing page for the tool bar to block a section of my email I am trying to click on to edit because the responsive design put the tool bar in the way.,,
I dislike some of the reports.,,
Video capabilities need to be added.,,
"It seems HubSpot would prefer you host your blog with them and, therefore, could be intentionally leaving limitations in place to get you to switch.",,
I'd love for there to be a basic free options with minimal tools available because all I really needed was basic email sending services for my newsletter.,,
"While the proprietary COS is easy to use once setup, making changes outside your templates (especially when it comes to styling) requires a strong knowledge of CSS.",,
Certain product features won't be accessible.,,
It took a while to get used to the buttons moving around and being organized in different places.,,
I also completely understand needing to verify email addresses before being able to send a marketing email from said email addresses,,
But there are some formatting issues that we run into when attempted to build these up.,,
You have to go through multiple pop up menus before you actually add a lead or task in.,,
"The limitations of HubSpot will become frustrating for anyone who enjoys coding, has specific tastes or requirements, or *enjoys* getting into the digital marketing weeds.",,

"Quisiera más herramientas de análisis, aunque están agregando más y mejorando algunas.",,
it might be some difficulty is verifying the records.,,
Their reporting is still lacking.,,
Clients are not always willing to spend more for items they feel should be included in what they already pay.,,
This means that some of my tweets and most of my activity on Instagram are not contained in the social analytics on Hubspot.,,
I was recently working on a program.,,
There's not much that I dislike about HubSpot.,,
"It takes significant time and effort to learn what you can do, and the potential of the system.",,
God forbid you need to make a small tweak to each landing page.,,
Sometimes you need to purchase third party add-ons to get additional features in HubSpot.,,

The only downside I've experienced in using Hubspot for social media marketing is that it's not super easy to downsize a photo that is too large for social media.,,
My other gripe is with the chatbot.,,

There are small things that are built into the system that you will find and want changed.,,
I sometimes feel that certain steps could be eliminated in the creating an email process but that might be more on the organization's end (aka my company) rather than the actual software itself.,,
I'm not sure if this is a Facebook issue or a Hubspot issue.,,

"Not much, It does what it is supposed to do.",,
It's hard to figure out the website building unless you're a developer.,,
I've also notices that sometimes the formatting of a post caption in HubSpot does not show up correctly once in the caption on the actual platform's post.,,

Workflow creation and query building are not that complex.,,

HubSpot seems to keep up with adding in new capabilities all the time to meet the needs of todays complex website development.,,

I would also like you to add tracking codes to the knowledge base.,,
The cost to acquire the product may be a little more accessible to allow all companies to use it.,,
The flip side of Hubspot doing almost everything is that it takes a while to get our team members and data on boarded and everyone up to speed.,,
It can be a big learning curve at first.,,

It requires a 12-month contract thats billed annually.,,
"For example the landing page builder, how does a tool like this still exist when drag-and-drop builders are ubiquitous throughout the marketing industry?!",,
I've had a hard time importing opt-out lists without errors.,,
The only thing I dislike is how the workflows are visually laid out.,,
The downside of such a straightforward platform is that some of the templates and building emails/landing pages a lot of functionality is missing.,,

It can be a little expensive for scale-up companies since your price is based on the number of contacts and that can grow very fast.,,
There isn't really anything I do not like about Hubspot.,,
While Hubspot has many great benefits there are little things you'll likely need to find a workaround for or comprise on to fit exactly what you need.,,

Their contact does delay a bit in response.,,
"I liked the old reporting and analytics dashboard better before they changed it, so it's taking some getting used to.",,
In order to pass some certification's you have to submit a practical assessment.,,
It does reduplicate contacts if entries are not the exact same.,,
Their free version is the one I use and it's great but a lot of the more helpful things are blocked behind a paywall.,,
"Some new features are not in-line with their platforms older products and it is sometimes not clear if you need to have some features enabled to get the best & intended use out of them,",,

Hi Sparky mobile app also does not tell you the activity owner but simply shows the activity type in Notes so can you be challenging to see who did White on the mobile app.,,

My number one complaint with HubSpot with website development related things is that you and your team can't work on pages simultaneously.,,

There are the occasional minor inconveniences like I wish I could change a few things about how some of the HubSpot generated properties appear and are grouped.,,
Images aren't always pulled to the preview.,,
"Workflow functionality is a bit limited in terms of timing and pathing, but HubSpot Support has been helpful with finding ways for us to make it do what we want it to.",,
I do not like the limited feature set in regards to email marketing.,,
Another aspect that could be improved is the advertising management function.,,
I do with that there was a feature that allowed you to send large amounts of emails through the system at once.,,
I wish there was more B2G help resources available.,,
"The more we do, the more it's clear HubSpot does everything you need effectively, but none of their tools have real depth.",,

I don't like the limitations.,,
It would also be nice to have a tab where I can store all of my hashtags that I use,,
HubSpot is limited in the handling of links from our website to external sites.,,
They really need to up there record allowance without the hefty fees.,,
The free plan does not allow you to program different tools.,,

The emails sometimes take months to write because the website is so slow.,,
"The module temple may be difficult for any marketer that don't know coding, even for small organisations whose IT teams are too busy to help marketer to create these modules templates.",,
The email marketing automation tool needs to be further developed - it is very limited when it comes to integrating with the website to pull privy information like product information,,
Extremely hard to think of anything negative about HubSpot.,,
"The only complaint or displeasure that I can have about HubSpot, is its slowness to upload information at the same time as my colleagues, the box that we own can sometimes collapse, however it is not something bigger because when refreshing the page, the data admitted we will see them without any problem.",,
"The calendar isn't a great feature, it's supposed to be a project management tool as well, but I don't use that part.",,
There are so many different tools and functionality that the on-boarding process can be time consuming.,,
"I wish there was a few more integrations, such as a direct integration with LinkedIn.",,
"It'd be really helpful to see Google, Facebook, LinkedIn from a single tagged campaign in one spot for comparison/discussion.",,
It only makes users add in stuff that either isn't true - or is just garbage to fit the extra words as I have done here.,,
My colleagues and I have experienced slight technical difficulties when using HubSpot which always makes the work more tedious.,,

I had to edit alot to be able to get it integrated.,,
Making custom templates and changes have not been intuitive thus far.,,
"Functionality does not include many instruments, and the data lacks depth.",,
Integrating my current from excel to this software was a bit time consuming.,,
"Also there are some pieces missing from some integrations that would be super helpful to include, but they work fine enough without being perfect.",,
"Personally what I do not like about HubSpot is its interface is not very nice visually, it deserves changes to make it look more attractive, they could make it more interesting.",,
"We started with a bit, looking for fast profits, with more and more confidence, then we activated more effective tools and improved our ROI.",,
The sheer number of functions and large operational capability can make the learning curve quite steep.,,
I had to research this before going through the steps to do it.,,
"At the level that we use it right now, I wont really see some week points.",,
"The biggest downside is when you first enter that asset area, you aren't able to stick to the folder view; you hit the full list of assets and need to manually toggle to folder view.",,
"None of the issues that I've run into are deal-breakers, but I have to find alternatives to achieving certain tasks.",,
It would be nice if the project tool allowed me to mark progression and set different due dates for different stages of the project.,,
This is my second implementation of Hubspot and the company has changed.,,
I find that the ease of use is a little bit lacking; the setup process could be somewhat clearer.,,

I do not really have any dislikes honestly about HubSpot and their marketing tools.,,
Reporting is not that easy with Hubspot and its difficult sometimes to get the data you want.,,
"It is very little in comparison to Salesforce, making it hard to store all data necessary for proper consolidation.",,
Once you start using it you'll see the nothing actually works until you but the next tier.,,
"Last but not least, the live preview does not render all JavaScript until it is released to the public.",,
No emails could go out either.,,
"The free plan has unlimited records, but once you are paying because you need other features not included on the free plan (like campaign management and sales tracking/sequence emails etc.)",,

If I had one wish it would be to have deal automation as an individual cost instead of having to pay for Sales pro if it's all you use from that module...,,

Design Manager for email marketing is not the most user-friendly at first and needs a bit of time to get used to.,,
HubSpot could easily integrate what HootSuite gives us.,,

Alternatively if there was a way to message multiple contacts at a time through the sales platform with integrated auto follow ups that would be great.,,
but it's always for the better!,,
I use the Social Publishing tool frequently and hate that I can't tag individuals on Facebook or LinkedIn.,,
"Right now, when I compile a weekly report for our social media channels, I am having to use HubSpot, Facebook Insights and Instagram Insights.",,
"Sometimed, I wiish",,
Very limited Quote options and the product database,,
We'd like metrics that directly identify marketing’s contribution to the sales pipeline and closed deals.,,
Luckily I spend most of my time with UX and that manager is a littler easier to work with.,,
"However, they have included all kinds of capabilities from social media tools, customer relation management (CRM) to CMS platform software.",,
You're limited with how deep you can go with analyzing content data across these platforms.,,
"One of the things I do not like are the design tools since they are somewhat complicated for good understanding, in addition, not all features can be handled, some features are limited and can be somewhat expensive.",,
"I'm not satisfied with their accounts team, I have been using HubSpot for two years, so far I haven't faced any issues with the tool except with their accounts team.",,
Limitations in fully integrating the software with social media platforms.,,
I end up opening 7 or 8 windows (at a minimum) to ensure the form is aligned to a workflow is aligned to a list is aligned to a landing page (and a thank you page) and that everyone is getting the right email.,,
"So for this, we use Google Analytics.",,
One thing is the communication from HubSpot when they make platform updates has not been great.,Actionable:updates:integrations,
"This software has everything covered, so in order to actually point out an issue, I will have to be extremely technical in nature.",,
It is easy for things to get cluttered very easily in the lists.,,
It seems a little over the top.,,
One thing is true - they listen to their customers and act quickly on providing solutions to whatever obstacles are inquired about.,support,
"I don't work directly on Hubspot, as I have a trained team managing the tool.",,
Keeping track of prospects and clients is also difficult to do with the features currently offered.,,
Some things that might seem intuitive at first are complicated to implement in Hubspot - especially regarding Landing Pages.,,
Hubspot definitely has a learning curve.,,
Design Manager is confusing for someone without coding knowledge.,,
"As our department grew, we realized there we're a lot of limitations.",,
"It is frustrating that videos can't be uploaded to Instagram, but I understand that is actually Instagram's settings.",,
The ongoing support from my account manager is second to none and I highly recommend looking at HubSpot.,,
As an agency we're working hard to complete the Agency certification.,,
Hubspot has too many tools!,,
"Despite the excellent customer service as I relate above, there a lot of people talking to us.",,
"I don't really like Hubspot's bugs and kinks, but the platform updates and alterations are often short-lived, due to the fast response times of the Hubspot team.",,
"This caused me some trouble, but happened in a minority of cases.",,
The HubSpot - Salesforce.com connection wasn't as transparent and easily viewed by the sales team as I had expected when we licensed the system.,,
"Other than that, which isn't even that horrible",,
It can be challenging to navigate this to make sure you're looking at the most important data.,,
"But once you are up and running, it's a breeze.",,
Difficult to find if a particular outcome/process is possible using current features.,,
I Hubspot could make creating templates a little bit easier.,,
"The price for the whole platform is very high, and you can not reduce costs by paying only for the modules you need.",,
", sometimes i can´t find some information or it takes me a while to find it.",,
"First off, the chat function is great; but half of my chats go to spam bot due to the conversation flow.",,
"You cannot clearly see who is getting what email, and when, and what is next for the, etc.",,
The Live chat is not as good as others  -Olark was much better.,,
Some suggestions to Customer Success Manager were implemented in later updates.,,
"The Marketing dashboards, integration with Slack, Ads, google analytics is incredible and makes my job so much easier
",,
"Sometimes, the integration of skype call causes delay when you are doping cold calls",,
"I would love for them to incorporate a way to post videos to Instagram, though and tag accounts like we can with Facebook and the others.",,
"Then again, I haven’t visited this",,
Reading messages doesn't feel natural,UX:Actionable,
HubSpot is very pricey which is why the companies I work for use other solutions.,,
Also the price,,
and I've run into a few issues there since we aren't paying for that service.,,
the software to constant updates that may be considered a disadvantage by some users.,updates,
There needs to be more price brackets.,,
You can not limit activity traces between mobile devices and desktops.,,
"Limits of number of lists (2000) one can create, 1000 of active lists and 1000 of static lists.",,
There isn't a lot of flexibility when creating emails or landing pages.,,
I think that some things which are easy to fix can take so long.,,
"Some of the tools could use a better organization system, or a system that allows for easier reorganization.",,
Also in depth customization of emails and landing pages is not always as easy as expected.,,
"At their price-point, I feel like that value should be expected.",,
/you invest enough time to learn how to use it correctly in order for it to be worth the investment.,,
design tools are still not the most intuitive.,UX,
"They're constantly improving reporting functionality relative to their Companies and Deals categories, but it's still pretty far behind the competition for comprehensiveness.",,
"Sometimes, the templates purchased are not very easy to understand and to work with!",,
"The software gets ""clunky"" as your business and database grows.",,
I know that this is something they're currently working on.,,
"If you are looking to do very complex lead scoring it can be a bit challenging, but overall it is",UX,
Scaling up can be quite expensive.,,
"Also, I don't like have when you mass schedule posts - the posts are seperated",,
They refuse to conduct a mind-meld with me despite repeated requests.,,
"I would maybe add the LinkedIn reporting and Facebook marketing APIs are not the greatest, but that might be due to those social media sites rules.",,
"There are tips and tricks that can help you do things a lot faster, but you have to know the tricks in order to do them.",UX:support,
The desktop site is significantly more thorough than my mobile options it seems.,,
"HubSpot used to let you connect infinite domains to your account - Unless you only want to set up a redirect, they now charge in the realm of $700 to connect a new domain!",,
"But the caveat to this is by charging a higher premium, they are able to focus on their customers more, because the customer care is outstanding.",price,
I dislike that only one tweet can be scheduled at the same time or with the same content.,,
I wish HubSpot provided more one-on-one strategy help for their clients.,,
"The system is missing many intuitive features like the ability to merge deals, and it often fails to populate information between deals, companies, and contacts.",,
It just takes a little time and really isn't that difficult.,,
"It would be nice to make our images accessible to all users, including those who are blind or low vision.",,
It takes far too long to make any sort of customizations that we want to (eg.,,
Including low image quality when uploading LinkedIn social media posts.,,
Very basic text based design.,,
The software is relatively new and limited for companies with advanced sale processes.,,
It means the software is slow down because of loading problems.,,
"I currently cannot cross report between Contacts and Engagements, which is very crucial for our analytics.",,
so I have to do this with the phone.,,
I love all aspects of the platform!,,
We came up with a workaround but they could have made that aspect easier.,,
My No. 1 complaint is that I can't use the social sharing tool over my phone.,,
Our company is currently using Hubspot for our Sales team and Marketing team.,,
and I can't have every client verify their email in my system just to receive a test.,,
We made a custom preference center that we wanted to dynamically update using a user ID but we had to make our own work-around using cookies.,,
"I also haven't found a great way to implement quizzes on the platform as neither Survey Monkey, nor Typeform allow you to create workflows based on a quiz score.",,
Hubspot has intuitive controls for your building web pages.,,
Now onto the not so good...,,
"I wish the sequences were more intelligent, similar to a workflow.",,
The software is easy to use and gives me real time email notifications.,,
Hubspot's new customer success system uses a team that I have no relationship with and that doesn't know anything about my business or our goals.,,
"Also, when they make an update to the platform, it really slows you down trying to find everything again.",,
It's something to consider if you have complex needs or need a very powerful tool.,,
It would be best if HubSpot can offer other language interfaces e.g. Chinese.,UX:features,
"Some things, especially with webpage development, are out of the customer service representative's scope.",,
I am not one that likes change and hey update how pages work about once a year.,,
"When I began starting HubSpot Partner in 2011, the software was simple and straightforward.",,
"(when I could actually do exactly what I want on MailChimp).
",,
"The two particular features I'd like to see improved are the following:
",,
"We've had to do a lot of training with our sales team on how to use the sales functionality, yet they still come to us with questions all the time.",,
"If you have a client that doesn't view many emails but still uses your services, they are put into a category that you have to be very specific on why you are emailing them, even if they have requested it.",,
One thing that could be improved is the overall campaign planning function.,features:UX,
"The UX for social media management isn't the nicest to use, but it gets the job done.",,
Very easy to have bad page design/CMS accepted as valid and this causes some of the problems.,,
I kind of understand their explanation (I have asked),,
"Because Hubspot tries to be all things to all people, none of its tools are as easy or powerful as tools made by companies that specialize.",,
"I think the downside is being overwhelmed, I feel like there might be a better way to organize everything.",,
Often a few hours lag between when we're mentioned on social media and when I see it in the Hubspot feed.,,
"If you have the budget to spend, do it.",,
"Also, there are certain functions in Chatbot that is not optimized yet, such as unable to set an online period of the Chatbot.",,
There isn't much to dislike with Hubspot.,,
"You really have to know what you're doing to use it, so it's not ideal for the average marketing manager to use to create campaign landing pages.",,
"It was never make-or-break, though.",,
Once you familiarize yourself with the layout it changes.,,
Very confusing; would have been helpful to have pre-built automations to customize and build off of,,
There are certain limitations when it comes to interacting with comments and retweets in HubSpot.,,
"Social Media/ Paid media tools are not up to par, especially with multiple clients and or branded product pages, if HubSpot bought Buffer and Buffer Reply this would seriously be THE ALL IN ONE TOOL.",,
"Restrictions on secondary owners and multiple companies associated with a contact have cause a lot of issues in reporting and creating workflows for syning properties through contacts, companies and deals.",,
No one tool within Hubspot is the best out there.,,
"There are some limitations with the free version, so if your looking for something free that is intuitive, I would look elsewhere.  ",,
I have yet to find anything withing HubSpot that I dislike.,,
HubSpot forms don't link up with Google Analytics.,,
Videos can't be scheduled for Instagram.,Actionable:wishes:features,
The cost can certainly price out a small business from scaling up without any gaurantee that they will see results.,,
Sending tracked emails on mobile is a pain compared to how seamless it is on desktop.,,
The page interface is very well done.,,
"like Hootsuite or Zoho social standards for scheduling, listening, and replies.",,
A design declutter would look easier to use.,,
"Wish that importing documents into emails could be a little easier, we have a lot of data sheets specific to serial numbers, so finding/attaching and making sure all is correct takes a bit of time.",,
As a SOLOPRENEUR I have found the platform to be overwhelming.,,
I don't currently dislike anything about Hubspot.,,
They often do updates and do not inform about it and may cause problems.,,
Each contact drops in a different person and our inboxes used to be full of emails.,Actionable:updates:features:bugs,
often I forget I already scheduled.,,
I would like reporting that was a little more comprehensive.,,
"The standardization of features limits flexibility to adapt the system to your requirements, you need to be ready to accept how the system works an not expect to be able to change everything.",,
Sometimes things break or are inconsistent as they make changes and add new features.,,
The issues with uploading images when scheduling social posts for LinkedIn.,,
"Also, great free CRM component but $200 per month just for reports seems a little...avaricious?",,
"Additionally, if you schedule or post on social via hubspot, GIFs dont come through until you're posting on twitter.",,
You need a developer because the pages even if from a template look bad after your change the branding.,,
"The UI change is something I am not a fan off, it makes it harder to find information.",,
but at the same time it was another opportunity for people to stair step.,,
"It is quite expensive, for a person who is starting to use this type of platforms",,
"There is so much on the screen at once, and its easy to get lost.",,
Withholding of adding metrics (CTR etc.),,
I am not a coder and making stylistic changes to HubSpot landing pages require coding.,,
"I wish it was easier to create and modify templates, not sure why it is still so difficult.",,
Any problems I have usually arise out of my own ignorance and can be quickly solved with the support team.,,
"The ad tool is not that useful, as I can only set up single ads (not ad groups)",,
I had a better experience with PipeDrive as far as that side of it all goes.,,
It takes some time for support to email you back.,,
For instance when you go into your contacts it would just be logical for them to be listed in alphabetical order automatically.,,
The customer support is very helpful and timely.,,
It's hard to understand the language when reading HubSpot field to Salesforce field requirements.,integrations:Actionable:UX,
The reporting functionalities aren't great.,,
"There are some functionality issues with the social media management, but I think that is dictated by the social platforms themselves, not HubSpot.",,
Hubspot strives to become a salesforce with huge walled gardens when they just do not have the same capabilities.,,
I like the menu which is build automatically.,,
HubSpot could use improvements in their sales software side of the business.,,
"It was very obvious when they made backend changes to the platform because everything immediately became extremely buggy (and without communication around these changes, it was very frustrating).",bugs:updates,
"Sometimes things are set up so that you can't do individual, tailored things as easily.",,
"For example, why aren't hard bounced contacts automatically removed from my account?",bugs:features:Actionable,
"Also, Hubspot doesn't offer integration with other platforms like Pandadocs.",,
"We are a young 4 year company, and if HubSpot's pricing was what it is now four years ago, there is no way we would have been able to purchase the software and then start selling the services we do now to clients.",price,
"In this sense, when we use it we are also using its particular vision of marketing and the way of managing it rather than our complete marketing design ideas and principles.",,
The available modules and templates are okay,,
"Specifically, the chat functionality of Messages should have more administrative features and users shouldn't require a Sales Pro license in order to review previous chats.",,
"after realising the functionality doesn't go much further than that showed in the demo, and being unhappy with onboarding, we cancelled just a month after signing up.",,
I cannot prioritize my callbacks by color or an icon nor set a specific call back time.,,
If they could do this - I would recommend any email marketing team use it.,,
The PRICING!,,
"yeah, it creates some bumps you know.",,
"Saying this, HubSpot are slowly working to solve these things.",,
I think the reporting capabilities are very elementary.,,
"Rogue companies are created automatically when HubSpot spots a corporate email being used by a customer for a non-corporate entity, but this is in no way HubSpot's fault.  ",,
By far the most superior marketing platform on the market.,,
"That to use a photo from the stock image library for social, you have to open another tab to add a photo to the file manager.",,
"If you don't use the whole ecosystem there are great integrations, but the value is limited significantly.",,
The add-on's can be a little ridiculous.,,
The negative thing about Hubspot is its media library for content and images.,,
"The price may put some people off - however, I see it a solid investment - and we expect to get 5-20x the return back.",,
Hubspot doesn't make it easy to understand where to go to find the right files or how to publish the HTML/CSS/etc codes on a blog.,,
"Things dont feel extremely responsive and there is a lot that they offer, but none of it feels very complete.",,
i really have nothing bad to say about hubspot.,,
Large teams often find themselves stepping on top of each other.,,
I loved every aspect of this tool at my previous company and hope to use it in the future.,,
A lot of the data driven aspects could be improved.,,
"If you import contact records, the email address after @ doesn't always attribute to the right organization.",bugs:Actionable:features,
All the platform is built on a contact approach and not company approach.,,
I really dislike how some leads are not appropriately sent to the correct sales advisor.,,
The toughest thing about using this platform is how long it takes to enter leads.,,
"There is little to dislike, but if I was to make one it would be that if you want to get more granular in making lists Marketo would have more control.",,
"Sometimes I have clients respond to my emails, but on Hubspot it doesn't show the client opening up the email.",bugs:Actionable:features,
"Through Hubspot, you can't post multiple Instagram photos, Gifs on Facebook, videos on Instagram, and sometimes multiple photos on Twitter.",,
"For professional version, the reporting capabilities are not fabulous.",,
The fact that you cannot search within or across contact timelines is a big hindrance.,,
I wish that we can make list based on companies.,,
It doesn't have certain features like the ability to attribute a closed deal to multiple marketing assets instead of just the asset that converted the lead.,,
My biggest pain point when it comes to HubSpot ads is the low budget allowance.,,
The bugs - sometimes on landing pages I have to enter text in the module view instead of in the landing page.,,
Not being able to filter tasks.,,
Really wish I could post multiple images on Instagram and that my images on LinkedIn would post in its original ratio.,features:wishes:Actionable,
it's tough to get all the contact properties sorted straight in my head.,,
I do wish that A/B testing was an available feature for the Marketing Starter package.,,
HubSpot has taken a long time to understand the begin using practically.,,
"Some bulk actions are difficult in Hubspot - for instance, bulk deleting contacts and adding companies in bulk to a list (as opposed to contacts) are both pretty challenging to accomplish if you're trying to use an excel spreadsheet to manage data and merge that with a list in Hubspot.",,
Inability to change templated items quickly,,
Sometimes it is a bit confusing to find a css and edit since it can be in several places along the hubspot.,,
I've just had a great experience.,,
The SEO tools are fairly limited in my opinion and it hasn't improved my traffic.,,
The upside to the course is that anyone who shares the portal can share portions of the practicum.,,
"There are limits on file sizes for social posting that the social networks don't have, because of this I can't do all of my social posting through the HubSpot platform.",features:Actionable:wishes,
Some of their products are still in beta,,
"For us, it makes more sense to be able to create a list and have that populate separately, vs having all leads come into the main contacts and then have to set a unique variable to get them into a prespecified list.",,
"There are a few features that I'd really like to see added such as exportable reports, but they are constantly working to add new features.",,
"The robustness of the program can sometimes make it difficult , or not so intuitive.",,
Little quirky things could be better.,,
"If it was more streamlined, it’d be easier to navigate.",,
It does not have that many integrations with other platforms.,,
Nowadays I am not sure if using Hubspot for free is really something with value.,,
Trapping clients at a high tier has been a real struggle for most uses which are not diligent in cleaning their list each month.,,
but you often find new features and that things have moved somewhere else.,,
so that's upsetting.,,
"The only issue I have with the platform is that I do not currently have authorizations for certain parts, like scheduling emails or publishing landing pages.",,
It would just be more convenient is all.,,
Some of the things I've done in Hubspot before the certification,,
As a first time user I am kind of lost as to what I should set up or how to do other than paying for a class.,,
It’s difficult to customize emails and landing pages without having intermediate HTML knowledge.,,
"If you're an advanced marketing automation user, you will easily become frustrated.",,
I find chat easier to use than email or a phone call because I can continue to work on other things while I'm waiting for the Hubspot support person to help me come up with an answer to my question and know that we are taking care of the issue in real-time instead of waiting for an email response.,,
"Also, their packages are a bit expensive.",,
"It is also difficult to place images in the exact place that you would like, which often means I just settle for the place that has been chosen or do not include images at all.",,
File management i have faceing fine to keep organized.,,
"It's super fast, cleanly designed, and the UI is well organized.",,
"For the marketing portion, you can only have one photo when you post, which isn't feasible.",,
I feel that there are things that HubSpot can do that would not require connectivity to other systems one simple things would be to do their own mail sends etc not use 3rd party.,,
The views available are not really set up to be able to easily optimize.,,
Automation is not perfect,,
I've liked everything so far.,,
"As a user of both the Sales & Marketing platforms, I wish there was more relationship between the Sales Templates we have in place and the Marketing Emails we've developed in the system.",,
It would be nicer to have in in the list section.,Actionable:wishes:UX,
I'm not a fan of the newly organized menus.,UX:updates,
"Sometimes when I open the email, it indicates that ""someone opened [email x].""",,
We use both the Marketing and Sales platforms and some parts of the Sales Pro solution needs some work.,,
Sometimes images don't display correctly and it's a task getting customer service to figure out the issue.,,
"It's easy to create forms and edit them, but if I want to, for example, send my user to a specific page because of a specific selection of a dropdown item, I can't.",,
"Otherwise, if someone changes the main content then we will not be able to keep track of that.
",,
This doesn't happen very often but sometimes we struggle with the support.,,
It's not always that intuitive and user-friendly.,,
These are all minor issues with the tool that we hope will be fixed in the future.,,
"Email template options very limited, unless you want to pay more.",,
"However, the forum is great for suggestions and ideas.",,
"Improvements can be made to the back-end system, i.e, renaming campaign names.",,
Adding a WYSIWYG option to the front end (instead of having to make changes in the design tools) would be helpful.,,
also waiting for Linkedin integration!,,
People expect more detailed reports out of your marketing campaigns.,,
The tools for creating and editing pages and emails are a bit more cumbersome and inflexible than you'll find in other standalone platforms.,,
It can be further simplified by demystifying the overall marketing and sales process.,,
"On the other hand, Hubspot can be pricey: I'm pretty sure that you can have much cheaper options if you use a competitor's tool for every tool that Hubspot has (but you'll lose the integrations between them).",,
"They always do a great job of informing you of where things are moving to and when, when a new feature will be available and how to use it.",,
"Whether or not these posts are delayed to the public or just to myself, I'm not sure.",,
They change with the times.,,
Ads module not supporting Bing or Quora.,,
Hasta el momento mi experiencia trabajando con esta plataforma,,
How inbound-based the program is.,,
I honestly feel as if you need to have a dedicated Hubspot expert at your company just to make their services work.,,
nothing at all - hubspot is great and user friendly,,
"But alas, no one seems to have figured this out yet.",,
"- The Plugins make data and deal entry so much easier
",,
"There are many more issues.
",,
"I primarily use Hubspot for marketing emails, and Hubspot does not focus on being a full-fledge email platform, so it's laking some basic functionality like certain A/B testing, ability to send emails at the individual customer's optimal time, and detailed reporting on best send days/times/subject lines.",,
They provide us with a lot of library knowledge to help us in understanding some of the topics that might related to what we are looking for.,,
There is only so much you can do on it when you aren't an admin.,,
It takes a little trial and error to figure out how all the features work together and how to get the most out of the tool.,,
"Yes, there are small things you'd like to change",,
"There are only a few tweaks I would make, for example the email editor is really confusing sometimes and not always the easiest to use.",,
so that I can make this my main hub for reporting.,,
I would love to get a mentor or something without having to pay for the expensive blocks.,,
too much emailing.,,
the learning curve for those not as tech savvy is quite steep from the start,,
"It requires a URL to start the process, after this step, you can count on the benefits of the system.",,
Since I work for a real estate company I have to schedule special ads when we are doing an ad specifically for a home.,,
"It seems like too many steps and verification needed to get accreditation, but that could also be because I have been using it when pressed for time.",,
It would be great if all the analytics were on the page they are measuring.,,
I dislike large scale layout changes that make it difficult to do work in the manner you were accustomed to.,,
"there weren't any notifications sent to my inbox telling me that there was an issue, and nothing was done until I manually checked back due to lower traffic.",,
"a través de la publicación de contenido optimizado para motores de búsqueda y la creación de contenido mucho mas efectivo y atractivo, para luego dirigirlo al publico indicado para logra de esta manera  ",,
"you still have to plan a great content strategy to get results from this tool, support for other languages is not available and is expensive, once you start working with this tool is hard to stop doing it because you mount all your marketing on their platform.",,
"I dislike that each dashboard for reporting can only hold a certain number of reports - why limit this?
",,
My only real complaint so far is that a couple of contacts have merged when a new contact has submitted a form by clicking on a forwarded email from someone already in the database.,,
I don't like how some of the features can only be unlocked by purchasing an entire bundle.,,
The customer service has been increasingly unhelpful.,,
There is a lot and it can be overwhelming.,,
"Frankly, the fact that they haven't done this yet is a bit mystifying.",,
I have used a few website building tools and usually just revert to writing  all of my html/css in an editor then uploading the code.,,
tener que actualizar la pagina para verificar que ha actualizado el contact result por ejemplo,,
I really don't have any complaints of the software.,,
Sometimes it does not drag all the information when they are related from some web page,,
Having a really clear plan for how to run a single simple campaign from start to finish.,,
"While the platform is very user friendly for self-serve marketers, I miss being able to easily code an email from scratch.",,
"I don't have a lot of complaints about this software, I've had a wonderful experience all this time.",,
Certain features are buried within a few menus and require additional clicks to access.,,
Security is at the forefront of our mind's here at Quantium and having to do this manually is extremely cumbersome.,,
We make emails for many clients and need to be able to test to them,,
"Mainly, I dislike the permissions structure.",,
"You lose FB ad editing functionality, as well as FB's attribution window tracking.",,
"I found out we had a support person assigned to our account (NOT once did he reach out to us, only communicated with the marketing company.  ",,
There is nothing I am lacking in the software.,,
"Few features in terms of segementation can be improved, may be make it easier to pull out data.
",,
I suggest you simply dig in and get started importing your contacts and reach out to support when you are stuck.,,
"The fact i cannot apply mandatory fields in collecting/inputting certain company or contact data.
",,
"I do have to use HubSpot in conjunction with other software and it would be nice to have a fuller solution, but I can't really complain because I'm not paying anything for it :)",,
CRM.It does seem that they continue to improve on what can and can't be done.,,
Why have a minimum word count?,,
I would like to social listen on other channels besides just Twitter.,,
"It's a bit expensive if you're using Sales, Marketing, and CRM.",,
There are a lot of things we could be getting for free elsewhere.,,
"Many times the updates of the information of a potential client are not saved, so the contact information would not be updated.",,
This causes us to need 3-4 workflows to complete an action that could conceptually be put into one workflow.,,
"Some of my coworkers, who are also very engaged, active users (meaning, they open/read each newsletter) were also kicked off our newsletters' email lists and aren't able to resign up for our newsletters because they've been blacklisted.",,
"Now System has many outages, error messages, and problems of sending emails, the Hubspot team are not responsive, now clearly looking for alternatives, but we have been invested a lot to Hubspot ,  migrating to another system will take some time and energy (many emails templates, landing pages, workflows) etc.",,
I can't come up with many negatives.,,
"For example, you can no longer publish to personal Facebook pages, GIFs continue to be difficult, etc.",,
I don’t have any dislikes at this time,,
It is great for all levels and has something for everyone.,,
"Again, I am new to Marketing, and feel comfortable browsing through our HubSpot instance to find a lot of material I need to my job.",,
So now I can create my workflows for automation a lot quicker!,,
-Dashboards.,,
It's more tedious than anything.,,
The challenge I faced with Hubspot is that there are different naming conventions and different ways the data is recorded when compared to Google Analytics.,,
"The workflows and lists can get confusing over time, especially if you are jumping onto an existing account.",,
"I will say upper management had issues with there being a lack of analytics, but since we have switched to a platform with it-they OBSESS over it.",,
The only thing I dislike about HubSpot is that you can't see what social posts converted new leads.,,
"After using something as simple as MailChimp, Hubspot definitely has a bit of a learning curve to it.",,
"If I had to pick something, I wish things like footers were more customizable with the formatting.",,
I think their revealing is a touch of lacking.,,
We always get great service and support to handle the issues!,,
"That being said, they are very responsive to whether or not users are pleased with the changes.",,
Not being able to post multiple photos to Instagram.,Actionable:bugs:features:wishes,
Probable as a result of the exceedingly high number of users,,
I dislike that the permissions are so expensive.,,
I'm an event coordinator and we use splash to register people for events.,,
So here my ans is negative in the case whether it has any things to dislike,,
Quite the jump.,,
"Sometimes it is frustrating integrating forms with other platforms, like Unbounce, because I can't see what the form looks like while I""m editing it, so sizing can be difficult.",integrations,
The import system needs to be a little smarter to recognize the contacts being updated and change the info in the profile instead of duplicating the contacts.,,
"However, HubSpot does keep up with frequent software changes and feature updates.",updates,
The end result is that sometimes you cannot do exactly what you wanted to do or see exactly the data you wanted because the UI limits the use cases for simplicity.,,
The reporting feature is not very useful in its current state.,,
If someone does not know how to do it they will not exploit the full potential of the app and end up not using it often.,,
I think social monitoring and publishing need some updates and improvements.,,
I would like to see the ability to do trigger campaigns to nurture leads.,,
"Sometimes the platform is ""too much"" for smaller businesses.",,
"ha sido muy agradable, con HubSpot tenemos la posibilidad de atraer mucho mas visitantes, dar a conocer nuestra marca y productos",,
Email templates are not available in mass emailing.,,
It is not the best for editing multiple emails at once and making major changes to many at once.,,
Many companies are oversold by zealous sales reps and find their expectations are not quite met when they get into the product so I would just suggest that the sales team better manage expectations.,,
Posting on LinkedIn via HubSpot often face with unsuccessful attempts or issue with the images.,bugs:features:integrations:Actionable,
Making them more user friendly would help a lot.,,
"In a company with more than 200 contacts in HS the need of space is a must and in our company we are missing some space, wich makes the CRM go slow and making us lose time creating lists or doing things that require more use of the space.",,
and I’ve probably uploaded the same image multiple times,Actionable:UX:bugs,
limitations on what you can do.,,
CMS is limited and will require custom code if you want to make a website.,,
If you are ready HubSpot is a great platform - if you're just getting started there's probably a better solution as you are easing into things unless you have the support that is familiar with HubSpot or relies very heavily on the HS team and their training materials.,,
try to talk to customer support for trouble shooting but not get proper revert,,
I wish there was a longer trial period or a promotional rate for trying out the paid features.,,
"SEO control and Ads Control starting to look very impressive, they are almost there when it comes to these areas.",,
I dislike the media library - that you have to upload images first to the media library before you can select them for the social post.,,
I do not find it easy to do anything,,
"Months later, any free product or limited campaign tool could've managed our single posting.  ",,
"It's a powerful tool, but you need to really dig in and learn it to get the most out of it.",,
I wish is was as robust as Salesforce.,,
so you have to clone and paste it in to a new email.,,
"I wish it was easier for our developer to manage backend development in Hubspot - he is constantly running into challenges when we try to customize emails or landing pages because of the way Hubspot is designed for non-technical users, rather than developers who have the skill to make code changes themselves.",,
"some fields you just ""can't"" build a smart list with - no logic to it.  ",,
"I am a very visual marketer, so creating extremely customized assets was a bit difficult.",,
"I guess support is ok for most product usage questions, but for more advanced usage you have to be creative.",,
so I have the ability.,,
"If they don't have an immediate answer, they always put the issue on their roadmap to improve our user experience.",,
Integrations with other marketing tools are limited - they want you to use absolutely everything in their platform even though some of their capabilities are not the best in the market e.g. email.,,
it has unique features which enables sales process very easy and to be managed,,
The ability to customize and complications internally to understand the distinction/value of contant vs. company vs. deal.,,
I would like %100 functionality built right into gmail,,
There is not much to dislike but the reports section in the marketing hub is sometimes inaccurate.,,
I think the pipeline side of it all could be handled a little better.,,
Drag and drop could be utilized more.,,
It would help new users greatly if there were more training programs with how to use the software made available tailored to unique to that specific business's goals.,,
"The email marketing and landing page builders are not that flexible, so I have to work hard to get the best out of it, which makes me lose some time on things that would be easier.",,
"Digital ad reporting, sources and campaign tracking could use some enhancements to drill down to individual ads.",Actionable:features:wishes,
It does not allow me to filter by date as much as I would like and I can't create custom reports in many cases.,,
(It was only in your Google inbox).,,
"During our migration last year from Wordpress to HubSpot, we lost the ability to make advanced image galleries using  the WordPress plugins of FooGallery and Justuified Image Galley which had many settings for how galleries look and animate.",,
The system isn't as user friendly as it could be.,,
There is nothing I dislike about Hubspot strongly enough to mention.,,
We're a partner agency and are 'all in' so there's not much that I would say I dislike.,,
I dislike the extended features.,,
I love Hubspot.,,
"But I do wish there were more customization features on certain things - for example, the contact form follow up emails to be styled more as your company's brand rather than a generic template.",,
"When you want to customize your website, there too many tools and it makes this process very complicated.",,
This happened 15-min.,,
The only functionality I wish was available was to set a schedule for individual social networks rather than a 'general' posting schedule.,Actionable:features:wishes,
"The only thing I wish you could do, is make duplicate profiles for customers that are working with more than one location.",,
"Hard to write to the designs, have to create multiple templates for everything.",,
When you create a new contact under an existing company name the system asks you to specify a company name for that contact.,,
The HubSpot Knowledge centre is great for learning about the product and self serving from the future,,
"At two different companies, I had major issues getting records to sync properly.",,
My least favorite element of Hubspot is the complexity of campaign creation.,,
"I'll usually have to set a number of drafts before the URL I'm linking to is live and then revisit to push the post as ""scheduled.",,
"There isn't a whole lot to dislike, but I would love to see a native ERP platform for manufacturing built into the system.",,
Data Visualization can be a little better.,,
"I""m not a fan of the new menu layout and often Hubspot change the layout of the product, which they do warn you about, but it doesn't always improve things.",,
MailChimp for e-mail and InstaPage for landingpages.,,
"There should be a sandbox environment to practice with new product features, train new team members, and complete practical exercises for the certification outside of the company's live portal.",,
( PPC excluded),,
We are not computer savy around here,,
"The popup forms are great, but shouldn't all be gated and you should be able to make them whatever color you need.",,
You have to rekey all that.,,
There isn't much to dislike.,,
It works so well and their support has been amazing especially in the beginning when I was messing up migration of data,,
I have not had any issues what so ever.,,
"I wanted to cancel my subscription but unfortunately you commit for a yearly contract if you decide to go with 90% off offer for start-ups.

"Also, the social media portion of the platform is not very helpful beyond scheduling Facebook and Twitter content and monitoring Twitter platforms.",,
The deal for forecast - for the month report on the sales dashboard does only shows the sales quota for the company as a whole and the the individual HubSpot user.,,
"I consider that HubSpot is a very complete tool, all its functions adapt very well to all my needs, I only have good comments towards this software, I have nothing bad to mention towards HubSpot.",,
"(Ex: I choose the Salesforce campaign in the form, but when I choose the form within landing pages, the salesforce campaign information doesn't transfer over.)

The necessity of using the CMS tool to see some insights into the web pages tool.,,
Their social tools could be improved.,UX:features:wishes,

I will probably hire an expert to help me with the remaining areas I want to learn really well.,,
Although now you can get started for free and work your way up which is great!,,
"When you are creating a blog post, sometimes the editing isn't smooth or intelligent and the text develops weird spacing, especially when dealing with images around the text.",,
There's just so much I could learn ;^),,
It's a terrible interface and cumbersome.,,
so I know there's real value in providing effective support.,,
The ability of the desktop app and the mobile doesn't match up.,,
i.e. website hosting and conversion tracking don't work if your not using their web hosting (but it seems like they are moving in the right direction,,
Sometimes the workflows are a little difficult to use.,,
"Being able to analyze the behavior with the emails we send is clutch. 
",,
"Also with workflows, you can only have people re enter a workflow based on certain criteria vs. just being able to say yes they can enter again or no.  ",,
There just isn't the ROI here to justify adding this to a subscription.,,
The questions were confusing and sometimes downright incorrect.,support:UX:Actionable,
The main flaw is the price.,price,
"It requires you to be really organized and it can be a little time consuming to get all your customer information input, but there are many automated data retrieval to help the input process.",,
I know that our uploaded images get very stuffy,,
"But if you have a smaller marketing department with little to no budget, it's costly to use the paid versions of their system.",,
"Occasional service outages, flawed integrations with some other platforms, and frustrating link-shortening in social media (all links are automatically shortened, either with our Bitly account or their in-app service.",,
"Fortunately, a global search solves that issue pretty quickly.",,
I also don't like how if my social media is unpublished I don't get notified.,wishes:bugs:features:Actionable:UX,
"For example, it could say that the best time to post on FB for our company is at 10am on Tuesdays based on past performance of our social posts.",,
"Worth investing, for sure.",,
"There are workarounds, namely you store most important information in properties.",,
Designing drip campaigns isn't as user-friendly as some other systems,,
There was no way I could find to add or remove modules within the email builder.,,
"Also, though the customization options are great, I feel the degree or extent to which customizations can be made is still quite restrictive.",,
The next price jump seems to be a little drastic.,price,
Sometimes it can be difficult to achieve the exact result we are looking for and often times,,
I honestly have yet to see anything i don't like about it!,,
"Of course, they want to sell their product, but sometimes it's done at the expense of the success of my clients.",,
"When you send a e-mail, you can schedule it.",,
the fact that the CRM is more of an afterthought.,,
"For very corporate teams, I can see the value.",,
It's confusing to get answers to questions you might have unless you have a deep understanding of how things are connected on the back end.,,
I'm not a big fan of the codes used in CTA button tracking as it doesn't seem to always play nice with GA.,,
I disagree with on HubSpot.,,
There are also just a couple nuances in the email builder.,,
* they could figure out how to embed new pictures in a link thumbnail via Hubspot.,,
"To be completely honest, there is not much I don't like about HubSpot.",,
"If we need to go further with a new characteristic, sometines it's not available yet by Hubspot developers.",,
"I fully understand your business model is to have as many paid users as possible but, this heavily hinders productivity.",,
"I think that with anything, the more that is added and available, the trickier it is to organize.",,
"This is understandable , because of the complexity of this software.",,
"The software is dense and the high level concepts are talked about and educated thorough out courses and tutorials but the very nuts and bolts part of doing anything takes time, trial and error, and a little confusion.",,
But if you want results you have to put in the work.,,
The workflow could be simplified and more process-driven as opposed to task-driven.,,
On one hand I loved them because many people are visual learners but on the other hand,,
Not intuitive without training on the system.,,
Was surprised to find no marketing strategy involved whatsoever.,,
so I’m,,
The biggest downside to Hubspot is that it's clearly a growing product (which is also sort of an upside).,,
Sometimes it can be slow at loading changes to the database or sending out email campaigns.,,
HubSpot works worldwide and has now it own CRM integrated.,integrations,
"Also, some of the database type data that we were looking to use only works for landing pages, not for email.",,
Seems like every time we want to do something new we have to pay more.,,
"I will at times not find what I am looking for, but within a couple hours I'm used to the new look.",,
Get the marketing hub and use Salesforce for your CRM.,,
Hubspot is a constantly developing company.,,
"The only option now is donately, which is lacking many features that our current donation database, DonorPerfect, has.",,
They have tried to simplify things recently.,,
It feels dated and clunky.,,
"However, the glitches are few and far between and have never backtracked our work too much.",,
"I completed the inbound marketing certification and attempted another hubspot certification, but I felt like I was watching the same videos with little tweaks.",,
HubSpot is somewhat of a basic CRM that offers minimal possibilities of personalized design or particular adaptations compared to some other solutions.,,
"Often times when I am putting together more technical marketing sequences we run into quite a lot of issues that can take several weeks to rectify before we are back on track. 
",,
"For some reason, all the content from the sign-up doesn't seem to sync well.",,
A negative side of Hubspot is the high additional cost to add different extra features.,,
One bad thing about working with a program that so many other customers love is it takes them a little longer to get to your requests for additional features.,,
"we also use the CRM feature for our sales team and they all find it really useful and much better and easier to use than other systems.
",,
"Over time you learn work arounds, but as a marketer with no background in coding was frustrating. 
",,
I sometimes felt like it was being dumbed down too much.,,
You have to work around the system to get it to segment the market by a person within the account.,,
We've always had to use something like Salesforce to get the CRM tools we need.,,
Wish that adding people worked as companies.,,
"For organizations that are heavily focused on measuring marketing performance and taking budget decisions based on that performance, HubSpot is still good but will need to be worked on a bit.",,
With so many options available to you it can be very easy to get overwhelmed with information overload!,,
Solo puede deducir que es una herramienta que se abre y tiene margen de mejoras.,,
Specially if you don't know where to start.,,
"The lists feature for contacts is often confusing and not as intuitive, especially when exporting these lists.",,
"The delineation between contact, company, and deal workflows gets annoying sometimes.",,
"The added cost of features that are great, but expensive.",,
There are some real limitations to reporting that have made it difficult to see the performance of our emails on anything more than the most basic level.,,
The fact that you cant search timelines seems like a basic feature that should be part of any CRM.,,
"It's a growing tool, with lots of new features coming out which is great, but a lot of the features are not fully baked when they come out.",,
It has a few complexities which I think a beginner will not understand in the very beginning.,,
The design tool can be a bit tricky at times.,,
"The lead scoring system, although helpful, feels a little disorganized in terms of UI.",,
"I can not have analytics of my business workflows, I can mixed at all business and customers workflows",,
I think it lacks some features that could help support ABM initiatives (please give us multi-touch attribution!!!).,,
It's one thing we miss from our old system.,,
I know and sure that they help with everything.,support,
Often has issues with scheduling functionality.,,
Not notified of fees prior to signing contract.,,
It checks something else entirely.,,
Clever pricing strategy from HubSPot.,,
"I primarily use the social media tools, and there are a lot of features that I'd like but aren't built out yet.",,
You can't make changes to your campaigns.,,
"Tiene muchas limitaciones a nivel de programación, lo que hace que devengan problemas de SEO posteriormente.",,
"There is a ton that it can do, so learning your way around can be a bit of a battle, but they have great resources and a super support team.",,
Once we fix it (in the works) I will shine.,,
I do not like the lengths I have to go to in order to learn how to use a new tool.,,
"I'd like help with hashtags, ie which are the most viewed.",,
"However, this is an issue that I foresee being fixed in time.",,
it’s pretty easy and intuitive.,,
"To be honest, I dislike the fact that my team doesn't use hubspot more.",,
I don't completely trust a lot of the Hubspot reporting and it doesn't let me slice and dice the data as much as I'd like to.,,
I really dislike that there is no testing environment.,,
One thing that I would like to see from Hubspot is maybe more courses to look into!,,
etc and the reporting dashboard.,,
Some of the navigation can occasionally be frustrating.,,
Occasionally the notifications get stuck in the top right corner of my computer and they only way to get them to go away is restart my computer.,,
"Some features can be glitchy at times, particularly the newer ones.",,
There is still room for functionality growth within HubSpot I would love to be able to see some of the campaign metrics and Social monitoring and reporting be able to be added to Dashboards.,,
Things change a lot.,,
I don't love the price for entry-level folks who don't have high volume of client outreach.,,
I believe you can connect an erp to hubspot with different connectors or through their API,,
The only thing I dislike at the moment is Hubspot hasn't fully integrated to work with Facebook analytics.,,
A lot of functionality is still in beta and rollouts for new functions are very slow.,,
"There are no options for multiple picture posts, and it, in some ways, seems like a step down from just posting on a phone in the social media app.",,
This marketing tool is constantly evolving and continues to widen its services.,,
We could use a full integration with LinkedIn Ads.,,
The breadth of functionality can create complexity.,,
ampliar el abanico de clientes potenciales.,,
I feel as though the software is not the most user friendly option for teams with little-to-no coding experience.,,
"We already had HubSpot when I joined, so I didn't go through the formal go-live.",,
"The landing page and email templates require some background dev knowledge, but other than that, Hubspot is very easy to use.",,
Sometimes something that would seem like obvious functionality doesn't exist in the platform.,,
It has everything that a CRM should.,,
The price point is sometimes a bit steep for my clients.,,
I dislike some of the glitches I've encountered.,,
"HubSpot has everything all in one place, but they don’t always have the best features.",,
"Check their blog posts. 
",,
There is very little I dislike about using HubSpot.,,
"However, the company does serve a large population of customers so it shouldn't be surprising that it doesn't meet the needs of every company.",,
HubSpot and Salesforce integration could be smoother.,,
I wish our customer success manager was more accessible.,,
"Lacks flexibility in terms of design, a lot of modules have to be coded so a decent knowledge of HTML bis required for quality assurance",,
There are some obscure features that I wish Hubspot had,,
"I would really appreciate if I could also post videos on Instagram, but I understand it does not provide the appropriate APIs.",,
The learning curve with HubSpot was a little bit difficult to get through but watching video tutorials made the process easier.,,
Special mention for the customer onboarding :),,
We get by with the free version and some other free plugins and softwares to fill in gaps.,,
Wish the website analytics could drill down further and help.you uncovermore trends with the Google Analytics integration.,,
"I will say that despite this, there are a ton of videos, help files, and even chat representatives to help me through issues, so I feel like they have really addressed the one hurdle to taking on the platform.",,
"It is hard to remove people from lists, especially when I am using it for events and people cancel.",,
I dislike the rate of improvement for the Blog and E-mail modules.,,
"Connecting contacts with companies is a little tedious as well, though it can be done.",,
So it's been a bit of a challenge to convince my organization to stay with it.,,
There are some key properties specially when i want to track ads investment or deal related that aren't vailable yet.,,
"For instance, it was impossible to copy the contact details of a client.",,
Then it gray's out the post and doesn't take it off altogether.,,
The social media feature is not great.,features,
Forms were automatically live and glitchy...,,
Would have liked more guidelines for migrating our website to hubspot before we began the process.,,
Unable to use polls features on Facebook and Twitter.,,
"I honestly don't have any complaints, I just wish we had switch over sooner as the pain point now is connecting it to our prior CRM, Microsoft Dynamics (which will still be used by some of the company).",,
I would love more of the drag and drop features for things like landing pages.,,
"I could use more pictures to be able to add for FB posts , however it's not a very big issue.",wishes:Actionable:features,
Locating details from a specific call or email sometimes takes a while.,,
"If you aren't fluent in code, then you'll have a difficult time using and being satisfied with the templates.",,
"The functionality around Deals and Deal Properties are pretty limited compared to Contacts and Contact Properties, which has held us back from using the software to its full potential in the past.",,
Even once that's done the framework is quite rigid.,,
I wish that I could type in the serial number to the email,,
It would be great if you could split a list in half yourself rather than having to use the A/B Setting.,,
"For instance, the search feature can make it a bit hard to find what you're looking for at times.",,
"-  HubSpot is so user-friendly.
",,
Sometimes simplicity can be a downside as in when there is only one option to do something,,
but if its not broken why bother trying to fix it.,,
There isn't really anything I can think of.,,
It would be good if we can secure customers data.,,
"Currently on the startup discount plan that makes the price 90% off, but wow does that price hike-up after a while!",price,
There is a lot to learn because of the sheer volume of tasks that HubSpot does.,,
I wish that the import and export of excel spreadsheets was a little more advanced and integrated as right now,,
Particularly the inability’s to track search words that drive people to our website.,,
But that's what YouTube is for!,,
The incredible level of support and pro features comes at a higher price than a lot of smaller businesses want to commit to.,,
They have a solid roadmap but do little with feedback and recommendations.,,
Reporting in general I find is very challenging.,,
Also there are so many bells and whistles that I haven’t even touched yet.,,
"Handmaking templates requires technical skill, but they're constantly making the template building easier.",,
The only thing i dislike about the software is the amount of notifications and emails you get at one time.,,
The training is super basic and general.,,
Emails don't look the same in Outlook which is a Hubspot error,,
"However, it is nice that they are all accessible in the same place, without having to leave my dashboard.",,
"When making webpages, it's difficult to tell by the titles what different modules look like without altering the template and trying them.",,
"Honestly, I can't think of anything.",,
"There's really nothing all too wrong with Hubspot, it's a very useful tool that can show you a lot of fantastic metrics.",,
We would have had to use a Zapier integration if we were to continue.,,
Being able to do so would be a huge help.,,
Maybe they could send me an email notification if I get a new chat message.,,
I honestly can't think of what I dislike besides the limits of the free account.,,
"The CMS of hubspot is not that user friendly, there are not that many templates/themes and plugins that you can use.",,
"Also, the company promotes the software as easy to set up (25 seconds or less); however, full setup requires significantly more time than that.",,
"I miss some options when creating reports, and also that they ""update"" the sections on hubspot almost monthly.",,
I find myself not knowing what I want and sometimes inspiration comes from all over.,,
"Hubspot is so robust, it is difficult to know where to start.",,
It made us kind of wish hubspot has an al la cart offer since we really were only using them for half of their features but had to pay for the entire system.,,
"So they have a subscription that is charged annually or if I am not wrong every 6 months, this is not a bad thing",,
It can be hard to understand how all the tools work together.,,
It is almost like Hubspot has it's own strange coding language.,,
Need more improvement in page creation..,,
We had to set up a double negative in the workflows to make this work.,,
"No one on our staff is an expert at HubSpot or code, so editing our custom templates is challenging at times.",,
Some of sections within Hubspot platform are difficult to find.,,
It's the best marketing automation platform for the money and includes a wide variety of features.,,
but I would like to see AI Automated tools that can integrate with both HubSpot and salesforce,,
Such a comprehensive solution naturally creates a certain dependency.,,
but I love the content features.,,
Very nice software.,,
"If you make a landing page look good on mobile, it looks bad on desktop or vice versa.",,
I've run into a few issues with social planning.,,
This is a deal-breaker if you use more than one language.,,
but this is as of Apr 2018.,,
The on-boarding cost is ridiculous.,price,
Especially when it comes to products that should be included in some of the packages.,,
"We are connected to our Salesforce CRM and sometimes data is overwritten that needs to be fixed, based on IP addresses, which can be tricky at a school with a shared computer.",,
"HubSpot provides a free version, which gives you access to a sufficient amount of their tools, but if you are looking to get the most of out the software you will need to pay - and it can get pricey.",,
Price - it's quite expensive.,,
The individual systems are not as sexy and sleek as dedicated services eg.,,
"Sometimes there's a bug which makes it difficult to move tickets in the deal flow, but I'm sure it'll get fixed soon.",bugs:Actionable,
It's nearly impossible to report on anything using the tool.,,
Wish I could see more data from the ad managers - almost like a BI tool.,,
I also wish the mobile app had more capabilities.,,
"In my experience, I have noticed that sometimes when the hubspot team make some changes to the inner code, this affect us in minimal ways.",,
"You should have more package options to use, since the system is a bit expensive, and it only shows a limited version and when you want to purchase the complete system it has its payment a bit high.",,
As far as I know Hubspot does not allow you to select a specific ad for housing with regards to HUD specifications.,,
"Less feature rich, and lacking some dynamic features that are available with Marketo.",,
I would like to send an email to all my contacts at one time using a template.,wishes:features:Actionable,
"Hubspot is extremely focused on contacts rather than companies, and while I think that's beneficial in some areas, it can make my job slightly difficult based on the industry I'm in.",,
- it's just a matter of knowing where to look.,,
"Chatbots and workflows are too basic, they require too many workarounds to cover even relatively simple scenarios.",Actionable:UX,
Sometimes it can be difficult to locate tools or features.,,
"It's a bit difficult to navigate the many features of HubSpot, as well as formally adding deals, projects/tasks to it as well.",,
I don't like that when I want to change little things in an email such as adding an additional block of text or image I have to go into the template to add the block.,,
"Not showing responses on marketing emails on workflows, we want to have more interactions, like no time frame delay to go to the next step, let the system be like an Active list and wait for the if/them branch to move contacts as they reply or interact.",features:wishes,
"The editor for landing pages is weak -  it can get really frustrating sometimes.
",,
blogs are not easy to customize or edit so we've had to use other tools for more advanced design or CSS requirements,,
Being able to quickly create what we need would be ideal.,,
they have some weaknesses around the edges of their main offering.,,
I have encountered intermittent downtime and found a few problems on the platform that have always been resolved and resolved very quickly.,,
The HubSpot mobile app is a disappointment.,,
"Another thing I dislike has to do with pricing, as it requires some serious investment from companies before deploying it.",price,
A few more updates to lists could be incorporated.,,
"Though the current workflow is good, it would be better if we are able to move the deals in different pipelines in one step. 
",,
It´s a little hard to get friendly with the app,,
"Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a campaign is published or if it is a draft, the language could be clearer around those elements.",,
Sometimes contacts do not transfer over with all of their properties through the onboarding process.,,
"I would like to add on HubSpot marketing, however, these issues have made me question whether it is a good idea or not, especially since HubSpot marketing is kind of a hefty investment for a smaller company.",,
The workflow process is sometimes not super clear and could be improved.,,
That affects your character count.,,
The email platform is one of the harder platforms I have used.,,
we tried it and found it too buggy- and went back to using Wordpress.,,
We have to pick a template before creating a landing page.,,
Could grow some capabilities in terms of social media and analytics as they are somewhat limited.,,
"I did get badgered once I signed up for something, but as soon as I sent them an email the phone calls stopped.",,
Many times their support team knows less than I do.,,
"For all of the social media platforms, I can post multiple when I post directly on their page.",,
When it's had little troubles glitchy,,
So far there is nothing I really dislike about HubSpot.,,
Sometimes we're not aware of them until our Customer Service Rep informs us.,,
The connectivity between HubSpot and social platforms can sometimes be weak.,,
"Instead of listening and talking us through our problems, often we're handed one-sheets explaining certain features that we don't need and aren't necessary.",,
The forms doesn't have much customization.,,
"They also send email follow-ups to make sure you're happy.
",,
A big part of my role is social media.,,
"They also provide with a certification to help us in ensuring that we have a proper knowledge and standard.
",,
We are having to use a third party (OneTrust|) to bodge a solution together.,,
"But because we are an agency, handling multiple accounts.",,
It would be nice to be able to AB test on small groups.,,
so we can triple check.,,
"Having a lot of contacts can quickly add up, and HubSpot is raising their prices again.",,
I really wish that the reports feature was more robust.,,
Maybe that not all emails are mobile-responsive.,bugs:Actionable:features,
"If I try to paste something into an email, I will paste it and sometimes have to wait for about 30-60 second for the site to respond.",,
Their lead scoring options could use some improvement.,,
That said the Hubspot community is more than willing to step in and help you with any issues you may have,,
"It would be easier with a system that when an update was ready, an alert let you know that you could update and delete the old template or file it under a new location for ""DNU""",,
I would love to use this program for a project I am developing for nonprofit organizations.,,
HubSpot is not cheap and is much better as an enterprise solution.,,
I think Hubspot needs to focus on the community suggestions more.,,
"The options available were good enough, but I feel like if we wanted a very specific system we might have struggled.",,
HubSpot has few sets of templates that can't be changed easily.,,
Simple things like customizing the Help centre you cannot do.,,
"Some of the content features can be a little restricting, e.g. email and landing page templates",,
We had to delete a ton of contacts and use MailChimp instead for one campaign.,,

I just couldn't find it.,UX,
Integration with SFDC lacking compared to Pardot for attribution of campaigns.,,

That can be slightly frustrating at times.,,
"Still evaluating, which means I haven't come across and deal-breakers, and hoping to continue in this direction.",,
Of all the things I like the least it would be the design manager area,,
There are some gaps when it comes to a contact vs company vs deal.,,
A list can get a little confusing when it isn't in date order.,,
"(see SFC) are dependent on 3rd party companies like Zapier - again, not intuitive.  ",,

"Whilst you can see stats, set up templates and add contacts, when it comes to the crunch the person signing off the emails has to send them.",,
You could a workflow with one set of criteria and a list with the same,,
HubSpot has great support for it's customers.,,
"Due to the proprietary features of some social media platforms, I have to go right to the source to post some things, which is an unfortunate extra step.",,
I am kind of disappointed that don't see a feature where I can edit all posts in for specific day in one go.,,
"I can schedule really far out in advance, and manage everything with one little tool.",,
I feel like we aren't using the full capabilities of HubSpot just yet,,
HubSpot is only as good as the data you put into the system and gather through lead generation.,,
Hubspots integration with splash & salesforce can be a little tricky sometimes.,,
A lot of the information comes off is it supposed to be easy to learn and I believe that unless you do these tasks on a regular basis they aren’t as easy as marketed,,
Projects could be expanded upon.,,
"You have to be vigilant about selecting who you choose to log/track each time you send an email, which isn't always easy to remember to do, considering how many emails we shoot off in a day.",,
"On the day of one of our routine on-boarding calls HubSpot had a system wide crash, we understand these things happen and assumed we'd get an update during our scheduled call.  ",,
"I haven't found anything that I dislike about it yet, other than we have to pay to access many of the features.",,
"You need to have a developer if you're to design a template, while this can easily be avoided if there were some high quality templates from HubSpot itself.",,
"Other than that, i dont really dislike anything else.",,
"It is very easy and intuitive to publish and promote a blog.

The reporting ad on is absolutely terrible.,,
It's glitchy at times but support is knowledgable,,
When looking at where things are connected such as images or pdf's - it doesn't track everything - so,,
The problem is that they do not want to be prompted with questions first.,,
The designs are becoming somewhat dated and are not as plug and play as other options in the market – especially on the landing page side.,,
The dashboard was easy to understand,,
but I'm worried that the result will be the same in all of them.,,
"Sometimes I find when searching widely for clients names, I'm unsure which is best to click on the company and/or client profile.",,
"I use the social media app a lot, and while it's good, I think there's still a lot of work that can be done there.

I wish it was more based on company cards then contact cards.,,

"It's not a big deal to me at the moment, but I understand that it could be for other users. 
",,
"We integrated it with many other software like Woodpecker or Typeform to collect all specifics about our clients and their needs.

There are only a few cons to the HubSpot Marketing automation but sometimes it create a little bit problem for us that it can be slow down when it track many contacts and accounts.,,
"It's expensive, but fits our budget.",,
I work best one on one when learning something like this and the training time just isn't enough.,,
"Their video training portal and KB  (HubSpot Academy) are also very well done, an endless resource of training, not only about their solution but also about marketing in general.",,
This is poor in terms of what one can execute.,,
Making progress and reporting a pretty big headache.,,
I have yet to find a thing I dislike.,,
"We have a unique case with our in-house data management, and HubSpot's platform often isn't able to accommodate some of our specific use cases.",,
"I think that vendors should be using topensource, robust coding languages, or having that option.",,
"From time to time it appears that the roll-out of new features eats away at my patience as others are chomping away at it expecting results to be delivered in a timely manner which HubSpot has begun to get away from, saving its users time while in development. 
",,
I'm also a huge fan of Hubspot support.,,
I also don't like the distinct differences between each section as they are not cohesive in design.,,
"I would like to post to Google My Business from Hubspot, and tag people, not just businesses (but that is probably an issue with the social media site).  ",,
It can be a chore to keep the CRM clean of contacts who aren't true sales/marketing leads.,,
The conversation management is pretty problematic.,,
Some of the integration pieces are a bit difficult to configure but HubSpot is still way ahead of many of the other platforms in this area.,,
I honestly have not found anything that I dislike about HubSpot.,,
The reporting is improving but still doesn't quite meet all of my needs.,,
Their support is not great.,,
"Even though they collect a lot of data, it could be processed in a more robust and efficient way to help sales people  to understand their performance better.",,
This should be something that comes as a default feature for all plans.,,
I wish that there was more opportunity for customization in the Professional plan.,,
"It is somewhat pricey and, sometimes, the workflow feature is just too simple.",,
"currently, I haven't come across any shortfall.",,
It can take sometime to learn all this features and how to actually understand what they are doing making it a learning curve.,,
Specifically setting workflows that automate field updates and routing vs. developing campaigns (nurture/drip/etc.),,
you're right in the middle of creating so,,
The page is not always structured in an intuitive way.,,
"You can basically only type the text, with none of the features we would logically need (although those ARE available for marketing emails).",,
"I also hope HubSpot can allow more API access to its data so that customers can use their preferred BI tools, such as Zoho Reporting, Domo, tableau, etc.",,
There are a lot of add-on features and the cost adds up quickly.,,
"This still baffles me, since this is primarily an email marketing platform.  ",,
"Something that I find curious is that I can still keep track of who mentions me, but I can not follow clients, prospects or competitors.",,
From looking at their change suggestion forums it looks like some of these updates are over a year old and have not been accomplished.,UX:updates:Actionable,
Folders in workflows are now a must because we use so many.,,
Does not have the capability of creating a password-protected portion of a website.,,

Facebook ads not yet integrated fully with Ads package.,,
"Like everything that I like, it would be a lot better if it were cheaper.. or free!",,
The import is a total burden.,,
HubSpot has a problem with some of their numbers no necessarily matching up.,,
The older style was a little clunky - they're doing much better since upgrade but there are still something ease of use issues when getting into templates.,,
Working with HubSpot from a CRM perspective is an administrator's worst nightmare.,UX:integrations,
Automated emails for the blog is also fantastic,,
The price...,price,
It can at times hold your hand a bit too much.,,
There should be an option to see forms revision history,,
There's not much that we dislike about HubSpot.,,
"For us, Hubspot has in some ways hurt where it should've helped.",,
"Also, it is extremely pricey.",,
"There isn't much to dislike in Hubspot, one area that I think could be improved is the ability to assign more than one campaign tag to pieces of content.",,
They really need to redo this from the ground up.,,
I dislike how it can be a bit confusing on some areas.,,
and it's SEO-based marketing functionality has room to improve.,,
My main dislike about the program is the startup cost.,,
The archaic functionality of each individual tool.,,
Our team is fully emersed in the Hubspot system.,,
"Can't really complain, from a standpoint of using the free version.",,
"Their customer service is amazing, and we have never gone without a solution to our problems.",,
There are a few key features and functionalities that are missing that can make it a pain to work with.,,
UI refreshes happen sporadically and piece-meal.,,
The folder option that is available does not allow me organize the pages properly.,UX,
"In HubSpot, in general, the features feel very ad-hoc added and there is very little total consistency across the software.",,
I wish it was easier to go from draft to posting multiple platform posts instead of cloning and deleting original.,,
"Hubspot seems wildly broad in its applications, which can actually impede our organization's ability to understand how best to apply it to our particular business needs.",,
"This integration, and how to ensure it is done correctly, was a bit difficult (though it was probably not a Hubspot issue, rather, a Salesforce issue).",,
Hubspot should create a few more pricing steps for small organizations.,,
Their customer support during our on-boarding phase was horrible.,updates:support,
We've found the social media tool to be lacking.,,
It can be a little pricy for individuals.,,
"To make use of all of Hubspot's features, you need to lock yourself into hosting content inside Hubspot's platform.",,
on your website.,,
"Additionally, I've had times where I tried to post something with a featured image from my site, and the post posted, but the image did not.",,
It is a bit clunky for multi teams and multi language marketing: country field not alphabetising when translated (how is that user friendly) and not being able to segment email reporting into teams who sent them.,,
It completes each task efficiently so I can focus on making the sale.,,
"I don't have any major dislikes, though I occasionally run into a situation where it would be nice to have added functionality in some areas.",,
"I don't really see the purpose of knowing which sites are verified, at least in my workplace",,
It is frustrating to have true reporting locked behind an additional paywall.,,
If Hubspot could offer a few more high quality out of system integrations it would be great.,,
There is a way to add the CSS code,bugs:UX,
"There are so many tools, I struggle to keep up with them all (but that's more on me than HS).",,
There is no single source way to find and report on all metrics for email social etc.,,
The social media content publishing part can be improved.,features:Actionable:wishes,
There can be too much information.,UX,
It is probably the best marketing automation tool available but still too pricey compared to other marketing automation platforms.,,
it's clunky and visually unappealing.,,
It has the answer to almost all my marketing problems.,,
"Updates and improvements come more often now, but can navigation and internal structure confusing.",,
Inability to post video's to instagram is a little bit of an issue.....,,
"I attend HubSpot's conference INBOUND every year to learn about the latest features, but it would be helpful to have someone to discuss strategy of implementing those features with.   ",,
The social integration is terrible.,,
"When I combine a contact that is a duplicate, I have to closely watch our custom properties that are ""multiple checkbox"" properties to make sure that all the information is transferred over.",,
One complaint would be that it is not as user friendly as some programs.,,
There is not much to say about dislikes to be honest.,,
- we've found that at times we're just redirected back to HubSpot articles and the agent doesn't try to understand our problem more clearly.,,
"I would like it to scrape like an API, all of the details from the companies' websites.",,
Remarketing emails from our Shopify API don't work perfectly,,
"For social media feature, I don't like that the image shows strange framing.",,
I like simplicity.,,
I kept getting kicked out the system.,,

The difficult learning curve for me because our backend is completely messed up by a previous user.,,
HubSpot could also try and make these better.,,
Every month I feel like an extra step is added to my processes from some little UI change.,,
When updating an email it could be better to save the email when you update it.,,
"I don't use hubspot's landing pages, personas or blog because I already have a website built.",,
The email templates are not as user friendly as I’d,,
"Time can only be measured by using the deal pipeline, it's limiting.",,
HubSpot could take a few tips and tricks from Unbounce in this arena.,,
but they just came out with it a couple of months ago,,
Little UI/UX changes constantly feel like one step forward two steps back.,,
There are times when I come across something that I would like to be changed with HubSpit however I can not think of anything that would seriously deter me from using this software.,,
"In addition, a column-view organization (similar to PipeDrive) would be helpful to visualize deals in the pipeline.",,
It was well worth the time to do this for the time savings and fantastic exposure and results.,,
it is also expensive but worth it.,,
"A couple of things I would like to see in HubSpot features -

I'd like to see more customization reporting and dashboard widgets in the new year too.,,
Would like more choices in fonts and customization options for design and appearance.,,
"The notes category where you put notes from a call or meeting, load your message into the main profile..",,
But I fully acknowledge that we're not using it to its full capability.,,
"Just check out their ideas forum, it is full of amazing enhancements they are working on.",,
"The main downside is that there is a huge gap cost between the plans, with first being affordable and great for what it delivers, and second one being unaffordable already to our team.",,
Sometimes it can be hard to get the front and spacing correct and how you want them.,,
This is likely more of an issue with LinkedIn than HubSpot itself.,,
and you can't post more than one photo to Facebook through the system.,,
"You need to upgrade your account to access the Email marketing part of Hubspot, it would be nice to test the email marketing part before subscribing",,
We wish there was a better way to link contacts and companies to have field information flow from one to the other.,,
"It is very expensive, and their website/email development/formatting system leaves a lot to be desired.",,
Some of their professional plans exceed $30 and the most expensive $200.,price,
It's unclear whether or not you can cut your package down to eliminate services  you aren't using.,,
"It is quite convenient to HubSpot, at the beginning without having to examine the tutorials, it has multiplatform messages and file sharing always helps to make the tool more and more outstanding, with HubSpot you can record group meetings that can be used as a reference for the future conferences.",,
It could be challenging to get the reports torun at times.,,
Fantastic that they take it into consideration to have a better user interface and give it a more efficient use.,,
"When browsing the community online, the missing features are suggested, but it takes literal years before anything comes to fruition.",,
Easy to get help.,,
Workflow does not allow deal properties.,,
It's like building with a set of very big Legos.,,
It takes a lot of time and questions to really know what and how to do a lot of different things.,,

It takes several weeks to have your website/blog design implemented into their content management system.,,
I have to filter by dates and then copy and paste into excel because there is no export option.,,
"a la interfaz pues está llena de opciones, posibilidades etc.",,
There isn't much that we dislike about Hubspot it does everything we need and again is very easy to use,,
The technical back-end aspects that relate to website and form construction sometimes conflict with our desired behavior; The tools provided aren’t as customizable as we need.,,
Your sample with extreme disorder.,,
Hubspot does have a considerable learning curve.,,
I have also been asking for the ability to globally block specific domains on all forms simultaneously.,,
We use it for marketing campangne and some time the localization doesn't work very good.,,

Learning curve at first can be a bit much.,UX,
"For instance, I like mailchimp or constant contact better than the email design tool in Hubspot.",,
There is a steep price increase and contracts are annual - it would be nice to have more flexibility here.,,
"Too many components you need to configure and use, complex setup, you need to spend way too much time with no guarantee on result, also over priced",,
Hubspot you should be ashamed of yourself for not creating things I haven't even thought of.,,
"The CRM is limited in its functionality in terms of cross referencing data sets from across the platform in Contacts, Companies and Deals, making reporting fiddly at times, and leaving us with somewhat no improvement on ease of mastering our metrics within the system",integrations:UX,
On the other end the functions enable you to save a lot from IT Dev costs.,,

"It's definitely takes training - maybe once you've used another similar tool, moving to this would be easier, but it was all new to us.",,
Why on earth can't I randomly split a list (this one boggles my mind)?,,
HubSpot does not allow extreme platform customization.,,
Now and again it tends to be a bit glitchy however HubSpot is continually improving and turning out with better approaches to improve their devices.,,
You're very limited in functionality compared to the paid plans to a point where it's simply annoying because they advertise the crap out of the totally FREE of charge plan.,price:integrations,
but then the total costing comes out to be a lot.,,
I hate the fact that HubSpot occasionally has errors it can't simulate in iOS and Android tests while previewing emails.,,
more of a drag and drop function instead of backend editing to get the theme just right.,,
There is no integration with Mac email programs.,,
They don't have time to update all the information from their sales.,,

There was constantly an incomplete % and no way to turn it off.,,
"I focus a lot on content creation, and I think their design manager is cumbersome, especially when compared to other tools for email and landing page creation.",,
HubSpot Support on the whole is valuable (aside from the fact that Chat and Call options are often unavailable for New Zealand based customers due to support staff based in Asia or US) but can be quite rigid in their approach to customer queries and what level of support they can provide within the limitations of the platform.,,
"Easy categorization through campaigns and tracking.

"My least favorite thing is workflows, closely followed by emails.",,
"If I were going to create a wishlist for things they would improve upon, I'd ask for conditional fields on records, even greater customization options in reporting, a more robust social listening tool, expansion of the marketing project management tool (it's nice, but basic - would love to see it move closer to something like Asana).",,
Many other HubSpot users have upvoted that request from over 1.5 years ago and HubSpot has not yet provided a remedy.,,

The lack of new designs in the marketplace.,,
¡Aprendo lentamente a veces cuando se trata de nuevo software!,,
It would also be nice to have a format painter that could clone formatting and apply it to another area.,,
I can't think of anything I dislike!,,
There are a lot of great add-ons for email marketing and social marketing that are too expensive for a small startup.,,
Hubspot is great!,,
I wish more info would send between Hubspot and Salesforce.,,
"There are things I would like to improve, such as having the ability to have an internal contact list for internal communications.",,
but we were never able to get a straight answer.,,
The only thing that is an issue with HubSpot now is the inability to fully report on WF's.,,
The dashboard doesn't perform well and needs to be constantly reloaded and that's not a good sign of positive user experience for someone that grades the same thing for others.,,
In addition to that the tasks often go unnoticed for not being on my calendar.,,
"They appear to no longer be including Facebook in the social posting section, which isn't ideal",,
"An experienced user had to teach me, rather than learning on my own.",UX:support,
I dislike how the different menus may not be intuitively obvious.,,
The reporting features aren't as powerful as some competitors and it can be cumbersome to maintain list hygiene.,,
Only after you've signed notified of more fees.,,
I also wish there was some kind of mobile app that was available where we could see any messages that come in from the messages feature.,wishes:features:Actionable,
constant changes and updates though they are usually valuable but they are not communicated other then in notifications,,
"When automating an email, I wish you could select a time to send out the emails instead of just delaying it by a certain number of days.",features:wishes,
There isn't anything I truly dislike about this product.,,
Had to cut them loose.,,
but I still use Google Analytics and Salesforce.com for the majority of my reporting & updates to the leadership team.,,
"I can always make it work, but it's not always the easiest.",,
Every area hubspot covers it barely scratches the surface of.,,
"Some features are not enterprise ready, mainly items relating to the service module- such as multi language support forms and knowledge base.",,
Hosting on HubSpot's servers also significantly diminished our flexibility from a design standpoint.,,
"If you have the budget, it is worth it.",,
I have to speak out loud!,,
"So you can't really trust it - however, if you could trust it - the tool would be invaluable, saving lots of time when re-organizing things in the landing pages.",,
"For all its brand recognition, Hubspot's product is lagging behind, and their investment in product development is aiming at enlarging capabilities into new teams, rather than going deeper and servicing existing customers better.",,
"While it is great for learning, it took several days to get some of the ""graded"" assignments back.",UX:support,
Social media offerings are weak and not remotely as good as managing social media directly on the platforms.,,
"I'm not sure exactly what we pay for HubSpot, but I know it's pricey.",,
"I wish there were more ways to edit and characterize the fonts and styles within a templet or sequence.

Reporting has made strides but is still a little bulky,,
"Product does change without notice,  other times, a ""warning, this is about to change"" doesn't happen for a long time if ever.",,
Social Media Analytics - You only get analytics for posts through HubSpot,,
less html coding.,,
HTML codes don't always work and sometimes when you ask for help they don't really give you advice to fix it.,,
"We found that while a powerful tool, we weren't using it to it's full capacity due to the size of our team and capacity.",,
I'm not a big fan of using modules in the email and landing page builder.,,
"It's way too easy to get duplicate contacts set up; however, it is also easy to merge them.",,
I feel like I'm being forced to use Hubspot's tools instead of what I feel as a marketer is most appropriate.,,
I also preferred the drag and drop editing of Eloqua over the templates in Hubspot.,,
It can take a while to get used to how some of these work.,,
The UI was clunky.,,
Also building templates is only easy if you know the theme very well and when you build a template it is not always user friendly for a content marketeer.,,
"The way it's set up right now allows for ease and good introductory e-mails, but when we really want it to be aligned with our brand aesthetic and marketing techniques, we have to create everything in photoshop as an image and then include it in the e-mail.",,
We need to export data from reports to get the data we want.,,
I'd like it if the link previews were created when the post goes live rather than when the draft is created.,,
I wish I had staffing to use all of the bells and whistles!,,
but I am limited when it comes to editing them,,
My boss had to sit down with me and show me how to use the website.,,
"I wish HubSpot could schedule videos and carousels to Instagram but despite that, I still prefer this platform over HootSuite when dealing with a large number of accounts.",,
To modify a landing page you must first modify its template then change the landing page itself.,,
"Your marketing is automated, and all you have to do is drop in your contact info while the system records every interaction for you, and fills in the gaps with automated emails that YOU set up.

It really takes a dedicated person to utilize the tool fully.,,
They try to do everything and you can't do everything well.,,
The constant changes - layout or naming of sections.,UX,
This seems to be related to the regular additions and updates to the system.,,
I don’t need the acting and such.,,
"(this is really not a big issue, but a consideration)",,
If the visitor isn't in our database we don't really get much information on them other than the source they used to get there.,,
Basically no contrary opinion.,,
This drives me up the wall.,UX,
"I think that the price gap should not be so instant, and there should be plans available in between.",,
"In addition, I’m unsure what’s going to happen with their on-site search.",,
I didn't find any quick support from the team when I was stuck in the beginning.,,
You can't summarize data from two fields.,,
"The community around it is simply amazing, with lots of local meeting groups, training sessions, workshops around the world
",,
Sometimes I feel like our emails are not as designed or responsive as they could be because I am limited so much by templates.,,
There are certain coding aspects of hubspot that can be hard to utilize with our backend.,,
"You don't get beautiful looking emails out of the box - there's a lot of development required to in the back end to create consistent, eye-catching templates.",,
They recommend to speak to a designer who checks the code and it is correct but the email still doesn't format,,
"They're reporting is good, but I'd like the add-on reporting features to be standard.",,
Hubspot lacks some flexibility around advanced customization.,,
There is a limit of 10 additional reports we can create but we don't need 1000s to upgrade to the next level so it is a bit annoying to try and stay within the limit of 10 or delete previous ones to get more info when needed.,,
"Very often Hubspot's metrics are not accurate, as I noticed regularly comparing the engagement results that appear on my Hubspot reports and the ""likes"" effectively received on Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter.  ",,
"Oh, and maybe the possibility to add/delete easily contacts in a smart list (it can be a bit confusing and time-spending).",,
Design templates were difficult to figure out at first.,,
"Various features can be better optimized.

We have canceled our agreement 7 months in and they not once asked us why or tried to support us to win us back.,,
"Automating social media posting from multiple accounts so you don't even have to think about it

"Pop Up Forms, not very customizable beyond a few basic things",,
The genuine stunt is to simply play with it for a piece to see how best to utilize the usefulness to suit your organization.,,
"Sometimes Hubspot will tell me I'm going to have an issue with a featured image on a post, but I've discovered that sometimes there is no actual image.",bugs:features:Actionable,

I also wish you can add more contacts to an email sequence than just one.,features:wishes:Actionable,
"In order to really make the reporting work, you need to host everything with Hubspot (landing pages and blog).",integrations,
I know that the problem is not the Hubspot itself but the poor internet connection.,,
Ideally I'd love a bit more customization options without totally sacrificing the simplicity.,,
"We have a variety of tools in our overall stack, and while HubSpot is very good at mobilizing data captured on its platform to be visualized outside of it, there is still room to improve.",,
That means adding things widgets to your webpages can be overly complicated or impossible.,,
I wish I could enroll more than one person at a time into a sequence.,,
However these cases are rare and they are usually just small inconveniences.,,
"That being the case, I often get messages while on the site that theire has been an error with backup, or workflows, or files.",,
If you need to know something it's likely,,
At every angle is a push to upgrade to one of the paid plans.,UX:price,
"Prior to HubSpot, I was mostly using more specialized marketing tools like Google Analytics, Buffer or MailChimp that do one thing really well.",,
HS Academy is great at solving that issue.,,
"I was new to Content marketing and the HubSpot Academy provided me with  a great understanding of what Content Marketing / Inbound Marketing was, how I could use it for my business and gave me hints and tips to get me going.",,
"When I'm looking at a contact in Salesforce, I want to know if that contact has hard bounced, since that is a good indicator that he left the company or",,
you can't customize the lifecycle stage.,,
I would love to know which blog posts are associated with which topic clusters from the Blog Manage page.,,
"Sometimes tagging companies in LinkedIn posts can be glitchy, this seems to be the case in LinkedIn itself though so it may not be the tool.",,
I'm sure for the majority of users this wouldn't be the case.,,
"Currently there are very limited form completion actions, though you can achieve the desired updates via workflows.",,
"I have to open the file in a new URL, save it to my computer, then open it as a PDF.",,
They've also added a lot separate tools that are add-on items that can give the impression that you're being nickel and dimed.,,
I have been trying to figure out with the software if you could create automated emails to customers that will send to them right away.,,
"Some seemingly obvious and fundamental tools are not available within the platform i.e. lead lifecycle stage customisation, de-dupping tool for contacts (only just rolled out this month), the reporting tool feels a little limited at times meaning we often have to look outside of HubSpot to resource our business requirements.",,
"One other issue is the tracking revenue through campaigns -- sometimes it is not accurate, which seems like a big issue, but it hasn't been resolved.",,
One would be a customer portal.,,
"In the function of ""live chat"" not every person of our team can received notification about who's writing in real time, but just the person who's being assigned the conversation.  ",,
It still needs to improve a lot as many it only covers the basics of marketing.,,

Not having the ability to bulk update reports-,,
"My IT guy also says it's not the most secure software and is vulnerable to phishing attacks, but I haven't found a better alternative that meets my needs as well at a price point I can afford.",,
"While we had a good price the first year we were with HubSpot, the significant increase we were going to see upon renewal is why we ultimately had to leave them.",,
The dashboard is slightly confusing on how best to navigate.,,
"I don't like that the campaign doesn't have a date range filter, and also you can export the results.",,
"The dev side of things with the module structure is pretty messy and buggy.
",,
"Want to compare spend, cohorts, etc.",,
The email design manager is terrible.,,
I still do that in HubSpot which may be my own limitation but having a place to edit my stylesheets next to the html with a live update would be extremely nice.,,
"* Easy to onboard new members since the interface is really user-friendly

"Also, still no A/B-Testing of Popups!  ",,
Wish they would respond more to suggested ideas in the community.,wishes:UX:Actionable,
This is a common problem (lots of hits on Google from people complaining) that support doesn't give a working answer to - deinstall and install again?,,
The project manager lacks the ability to effectively filter and each for tasks.,,
We are pretty immature users,,
"For all of the social platforms, posting photos is a little too involved, and I often find myself using the apps ease.",,
We manufacture for the transportation industry which sells to municipalities and the buying process can be very fragmented.,,
"On the surface, I have no complaints, and anything negative I have to say would be very particular that only extensive users would identify with.",,
and therefore it is never a seamless process.,,
"For example, we love the pop-ups for collecting additional info but they are only included on lead flows but can't automatically connect them to a workflow.",,
"While that may be out of Hubspot's control, but it's still a frustration.",,
It's not as built out as WordPress and it's been a frustrating part.,,
It's easy to get lost.,UX,
"I dislike the company's aggressive contractual business model.

We were impressed by the software as the calendar offers me a clear vision of what should be planned for the next few days.,,
You'll have to come up with workarounds or manually build out programs as your business scales.,,
I don't like that after taking the test that you are not told which questions were correct and incorrect.,UX:Actionable,
"The learning curve for new, less tech-friendly users.",,
I would only say that I'd like to see more RAW data but above all it reallly has nothing to dislike about.,,
Being able to see how others are using workflows to streamline their business would be a major help in expanding out workflow library.,,
"For sales, it takes so long to complete the process of recording a call it slows you down.",,
"Only as a suggestion, I think that as we found out, for some Start-ups or small companies, to have an easier access to Enterprise Package would really help.",,
"Specially for ecommerce Hubspot is not the best CMS for you, we are building our own ecommerce/webshop in Hubspot now.",integrations:Actionable,
"With recent updates, the intuitiveness is in fact reduced.",UX:updates,
"I dislike that hubspot does not have as many capabilities as salesforce lead tracking system, though hubspot is cheaper than salesforce add on.",,
Another shortcoming is related to the Salesforce integration and the inability to use Campaign Member Status as a filter in HubSpot lists.,,
Some of the more technical CSS issues can be fiddly and temperamental.,,
"Because HubSpot is written partially in its own markup language, users lose a little control over design of emails and other assets.",,
"We tried to, then HubSpot said our site was too comolex, so we're kind of stuck with what we have.",,
Cannot view workflows in the initial workflows screen.,,
The drag and drop feature is not really the drag and drop,,
"When things aren't intuitive. 
",,
"The one thing that I dislike about Hubspot is on occasion, the ""Help"" feature will direct you to articles to read instead of focusing on steps to solve the question.  ",,
"Being relatively new to the market still, HubSpot keeps on involving, so things move around a bit and options change, so I have to sometimes go looking for things when I thought I knew where they were.",,
You may find yourself asking for a little more complexity from the tool.,,
There have been (few and far between),,
We haven't run into anything that can't be taken care of.,,
I admit it's not perfect,,
Hubspot is my first go-to blog for everything Marketing.,,
"And then, as your business grows, they'll upcharge you for more contacts and more whatever bull.  ",,
"Also, there should be an option to change the way that e-mails look between desktops and mobile.",,
HubSpot is not for the novice.,,
"They don't try to solve problems or create value for the customer, it's all about getting you enough into their ecosystem to upsell you.  ",,
A/B testing is only available on emails of a certain recipient size - troublesome if you're still growing your subscriber base.,,
It's SEO features are also a touch weak.,,
"When the design of the website failed to keep up with our stage as a company, we started hosting the site ourselves to in order to give our designer more options in changing the overall look and feel of the site.",,
There are some areas of the software which require further build out.,,
"The downside for me while using Hubspot is that our team uses Word Press for our blog, and it would be incredibly difficult to transfer all of our blog posts to the HS blog software because we would lose our tracking, ranking, and stats.",,
"I do not see any negative aspect in this tool, only that I would like to gradually add more functions and improve it!",,
I'd love to be able to use pop-ups with either of these lead nurturing mechanisms.,,
"But we're back to sending things to the Marketing team over email to get ""live"" updates of events onto the corporate accounts.",,
I had to purchase a separate software to do so and will eventually phase all social posting to this site.,,
At that point I believe you have to dig into the coding to adjust some of the breaks.,,
Then they took away the phone and chat support without warning.,features:updates,
I also think there is a big opportunity in the reporting area.,,
The dashboard doesn't allow us to track some of the line items we want to stay on top of.,,
I also wish that I had a little more freedom on how everything was organized on HubSpot.,,
The only thing I dislike is I feel like HubSpot is watering down their analytics and reporting.,,
It's not as versatile for SDRs.,,
We have a great designer and ended up building out our templates on our own.,,
And they then changed their whole product.,,
They could definitely do better on the salesforce integration side of things.,,
Getting templates set up with fields was a little difficult.,,
The GDPR tools rollout was pretty painful and seemed poorly planned.,,
"CRM, lack of email segmentation, breaking out the consumers.",wishes:features:Actionable,
"The social media scheduling tool isn't as developed as other tools focused on that, but they have recently improved it.",,
The solutions was more valuable with Google like analytics support.,,
"Unbeknownst to me they DELETE your account after 120 days without logging in, with very little notice.",,
Hubspot cannot be an smb tool but still own data and make it hard to connect outside apis when you want to extract.,,
"It took some time to get used to how to use the software, but the team loves it.",,
Hubspot's template makers are not so intuitive.,UX,
"Adding/removing people from lists - it would be great if there was a quicker way of doing this, rather than having to go into each contact.",,
The only downside would be that it's a little more involved,,
I would recommmend making a full form style editor in hubspot.,,
"Very little to dislike, but changes/ updates to the platform can occasionally throw us off, as features that were once present may get discontinued or will be found somewhere else.",,
"That said, their local customer success team is great and they try their best to help.",,
I wish it wasn't so expensive or that the social media tools were included in the non-professional level.,,
I've called to receive help with one of the files that automatically pulls.,,
The hubspot chat support is extremely good.,,
Possible training course / certification specifically for CRM users?,,
"For the best converting site, and to utilize the full range of features Hubspot would be the website entirely.  
",,
"Quite expensive, especially to start out if you're interested in specific features.",,
"There is not much that I dislike about HubSpot, although our business would love a cart and check-out implementation.",,
I dislike the some of the ads module functionalities.,,
"For example, I may have 60 out of 100 entries whose 'owner' I want to remove, but I have to manually do so for each entry by opening numerous tabs.",,
I've used other enterprise CRM's and marketing automation tools and the cost of Hubspot can be comparable very quickly,,
Some of the 'apps' within the software can be quite difficult to use when one is not accustomed to using it for the first time,,
but still that would be an awesome feature.,,
"In particular, filters for contact smartlists don't follow basic logic.",,
We had to look for a workaround for services such as Yotpo and Moz.,,
"Sometimes when I create the custom HTML for the email, The final output will be not friendly to use in different email clients.",,
They are draggable vertically but it cuts off the html and can be disorienting until you get used to it.,,
"His review showed what we already knew, the marketing firm did not set it up properly and Hubspot was underutilized.   ",,
"Workflows have been improved as a whole, but the most annoying thing is the way you have to do branching.",,
"Similarly, I believe that the Landing Pages creation system is too limited.",,
The analytics tool does not calculate everything too.,,
I dislike that it costs so much to use every year.,,
and it's too expensive for them.,,
"Other than that, solid tool.",,
" Right now I wish they were better marketing dashboards to take advantage of, since the sales dashboard’s are super robust and informative.",,
You also are only able to get the data they summarize which isn't helpful.,,
HubSpot recently removed the Undo/Redo buttons in the page editor.,,
"Sometimes during the past two years HubSpot has deployed new UI features perhaps a bit too eagerly in the beta mode, which has resulted in some anxiety, but have always been open for feedback.",,
"With the ability to guide customers through the sales process, from a potential lead to a closed sale, it's a seamless experience.",,
"For example, how to customize things in Hubble vs css.",,
"Also, I think the reporting functionality could be enhanced further to share much better insights.
",,
"While HubSpot does a solid job at all of the things listed above, it doesn't do an amazing job at any of them.",,
"- Free trials available

There isn't anything I've found to dislike about Hubspot yet.,,
"However, not having the ability to post/manage Instagram accounts creates another step for us outside of the software.",,
Problematic if a contact owns or works with multiple companies.,,
"I think that it is not user friendly, and is very difficult to work with.",,
It would be better if they come up with a solution to this,,
"I find it more efficient to go to each social networking platform and post as I can mention this way (for Facebook, HubSpot no longer has this feature), size correctly, and receive better and more robust analytics.",,
I also wish it were easier for two people to work on the same email or landing page at the same time without causing any saving issues.,,
I think the one issue I have is with how template updates are pushed through.,,
and I had no idea this was happening until someone responded and told me.,,
COS also lacks the robust plug-in ecosystem similar to WordPress.,,
Dashboards are a Godsend.,,
The upside of Hubspot is the giant user base and knowledge center that has answers to most of your questions.,,
"It's a simple fix, but I'd like the data I input be saved the first time.",,
"there is an excellent range of integrations from partners, including BlogMutt, a great source for blogging content.",,
That I can’t send mass emails.,wishes:features:Actionable,
Social media integration could stand to be more robust-,,
"We started using it a bit ago, so we will see how things go from here!",,
"While sequences are great, I wish they could be tied to workflows.  ",,
It would also be nice to add in marketing activity and links to this activity that were not implemented through HubSpot.,,
"I wish there were additional features available in their freemium package,  which would be especially helpful for lean startups to use before considering upgrading to a more premium account.",,
I've had to unsubscribe to about 5 different HubSpot emails.,,
There have been times where 'setting and forgetting' isn't the best idea.,,
"The Hubspot support is stellar, but for the average business owner, there is SO much that Hubspot can do that it can be intimidating to know where to start and what you need and don't need.",,
It helps us to take control over our clients and sales process.,,
"For example you easily get to the ""Age""",,
"It is not a lack of feature that would impact on using, but a plus.",,
"Smart send is not available in A/B testing, which is very much required is our case.",,
It can be a little complex for users that don't know how to use it to it's full potential.,,
"The problem with being easy to use is that it also has technically fewer capabilities than say, Marketo.",,
"Additionally, there have been many discrepancies between figures on Hubspot (eg.",,
It feels like a product that has been designed by different product teams.,,
Notifications has some error because at times it shows older notification as new one.,,
For some features I've had to search some time.,,
I also would like a tool that made it easier to bulk de-duplicate companies.,,
The workflows can be overwhelming to create the first time.,,
That means no contacts could be entered or looked up when we were at a trade show.,,
so its easy to navigate to a month and contact if your fiscal and goal needs to be updated in the middle of the year.,,
Some things are really hard to find - i.e. how to edit the email templates.,,
Setting up a website in Hubspot does require some knowledge of coding or this needs to be outsourced if you do not have the skills in-house.,,
"making changes to a website page, or creating a newsletter template).",,
you need the answer right now (if the creation is something difficult to put down).,,
The calendar is fantastic but I would love being able to synchronize it with my google calendar.,,
"Although we are very Inbound focused, like most organizations, it is not the sole channel of growth.",,
"New products also get introduced in Beta, but then remain in Beta for so long with no updates on a full version coming out.",,
They were really good in keeping us updated and ensuring the service would be up and running in a short time.,updates:support,

Would like to be able to autoschedule when people are most likely to see posts.,,
"While simplicity is great, it can sometimes limit your ability to perform tasks you want it to do.",,
"We have found ways around this, but it's a very annoying feature.",,
"Also their Salesforce integration still has some bugs that they weren't able to solve, and their customer technical support is ok, but the reps sometimes take a while to actually understand the problem.",,
Sometimes I feel like HubSpot changes things just to change things.,,
I would much rather recommend designing your own site through Sqaurespace and linking it to Hubspot for data collection and traffic monitoring.,Actionable:UX:integrations,
Limitations in the email development platform.,,
"A feature that logs incoming calls and not just outgoing calls would be useful as well, but I think that they are actually working on both of these.",,
We aim to get a complete view of how Marketing is influencing sales cycles from start to finish and all the engagement points that take place in between down to the campaign and even contact level.,,
The compromise with HubSPot may be the inability to customize some things to the extent you would like to if the platform was flexible enough.,,
"Building emails can be frustrating as it's hard to undo just one or two steps, you have to view previous revisions and due to the autosave feature these can be old and don't account for recent changes.",,
"That many places still allow dirty data (does not format phone numbers or capitalize country names, etc.",,
"Also, just a heads up if you're hosting your website on HubSpot and need to customize something, make sure you have a Web Specialist on hand to assist you because you will need to go into the code to make adjustments.",,
Maybe having a system in place to let us know 5 minutes before that a social media post is going to go out,wishes:Actionable:features,
The mobile features are poor..,,
They've only recently added a drag and drop email editor feature - which is a given across most ESPs.,,
There isn't much to dislike about HubSpot.,,
"Very worthwhile, but no small undertaking.",,
"Integrations bridge all the gaps that I'm missing with analytics etc, but I would love to have a deeper view of things going on in my organization.",,
"Although I love Hubspot, there are a few things to gripe about.",,
"They have also recently added some template editing features (drop and drag) in to the landing page and email builder but the functionality isn't quite there yet - it's very clunky, definitely needs some improvement.",,
"There are the occasional inconveniences/glitches such as thumbnails not being pulled for links or updates to social media being unintentionally scheduled twice, but overall the issues seem to be addressed and fixed really quickly!",,
"The system navigation has changed a bit since we first implemented, so it has been a little confusing trying to remember where everything is.",,
I think the price of this product is a little bit high otherwise it is an amazing product for marketers.,,
We were able to work with the regular customer service and get all set up on our own.,,
The formatting features are not always the best when using the web content management.,,
This is something that I would like to see implemented in the future.,,
The product and services are excellent.,,
There really  isnt one thing that i dislike about this product.,,
Content editors are sometimes flaky.,,
We are finding the attribution reporting to be a little challenging.,,
Landing page customization is not as intuitive as i had anticipated.,,
I love HubSpot,,
There aren't anythings that I've run into that I've come to dislike about HubSpot.,,
There isn't much that I don't like about HubSpot.,,
It used to be easier to change rules when making lists.,,
Nothing substantial.,,
"The lingo is slightly different from other CRMs, so it would be nice if there was a cheat sheet (or maybe there is and I couldn't find it quickly) to explain what a ""lead"" vs. a ""deal"" is and other terms that mean slightly different things in other databases.",,
When I moved roles we flirted with other CRMs and one aspect that I believe a lot of other CRMs are doing that Hubspot aren't is a 'tagging' system.,,
The on-boarding is a joke.,,
I wish there were easier ways to pull reports and there was the ability to tag customers with specific attributes.,,
Essentially - having it in one place would be the most helpful.,,
It makes tracking much visual and easier.,,
It is difficult to upload a video for publication.,,
Nothing so far the website is very user friendly & I find I use it all the time.,,
"I also hate using it on mobile, Hubspot needs to be able to be mobile friendly.",,
I think HubSpot is a work in progress and they still need to add many useful features to their tools.,,
How the social media tool doesn't show me which of my contact converted on which message,,
"Currently, I export all my social posts into google calendar for that.",,
Prefer them together.,,
"Although I understand the company needs to make a profit, it would make it a lot easier for small businesses to use.",,
"Want hubspot to add more analytics tools, though it has improved a lot for last couple of years.",,
"Despite being flexible, sometimes very basic functionality is missing.",,
For what we're currently using it for it's quite pricey for a non-profit organization.,,
I dislike that when I search a name or a template it has to be so exact.,,
"and I just love it.

I find the tool not very intuitive or user-friendly.,,
"It set easy reminders to not forget any info.

The cost per contact is high.,,
Oftentimes the technical documentation does not match updates made to the platform/software.,,
Our agency uses it so I can still log emails.,,
"Not much, but every now and then, there are a few functionalities that I wish it had.",,
A better filter system may help in searching for specific pages.,,
"When handing projects off to various team members, it can sometimes be hard to remember to go back in and edit those rules for mobile and tablet sizes as we make changes.",,
It would be harder to use this software without having some prior knowledge about it as well.,,
"To that end, as we try to build workarounds, the lack of a sandbox environment means that mistakes are costly.",,
The per contact pricing is a barrier.,price,
One big setback would be the missing feature of copying work done in a Sandbox account over to the live account.,,
"I do not like when things change drastically, I at first did not like when it changed over to having access to everything on one page",,
"The e-mail is saved as a draft, then sent when you choose to.",,
"It's OUTRAGEOUS that automated email sequences don't support A/B testing, and this is just one example.",,
"Being such an expansive resource you can often get lost or not know where to start, they do a good job of making it somewhat simple.",,
Navigating the content management solution can also be difficult.,,
I love that I can always count on someone to answer my question patiently and until we get an answer that really helps me.,Actionable:UX:support,
The social media scheduling is not great.,,
"You should have the one option that allows you to send an email to several clients at once and not do it one by one as it is currently done, integrating this option would make the process more agile.",,
"I don't know if its technical reasons or updates, but it throws off my flow whenever it happens.",,
"I do, however, like that we have the ability to submit feedback and feature requests.",,
"So I think that if there is any downfall with Hubspot, it may be that they are not the always the leader in the market.",,
I can't say that there is anything specific within the software that I dislike.,,
But to conclude that it provide the best customization services and it is always great for all the marketing needs.,,
I haven't used the software enough to make a decision.,,
Their customer support and love chat have helped me with all my problems,,
I also ould change the settings in the LinkedIn posts (Social)  - as not every picture looks great after posting,,
I wish HubSpot incorporated a keyword and competitor research tool so we didn't have to purchase that separately.,,
You can't drill down on any reports.,,
and I'd like to see more functionality added in the future,,
"The theme of the UI is very white, when viewing dashboards late at night can be a little blinding, a dark theme would be a handy add on.",UX:wishes,
Having the opportunity to track traffic from Pinterest and each Pin would be a very beneficial tool.,,
I think you can improve the UI/UX of templates tool and to study how to make easier the follow up template email.,,

"There are a few quirks to learn in reporting and channel attribution, but if you have a good HUbSpot rep, there is no issue.",,
but they're constantly updating and improving everything.,,
I would love to have a tool for keywords analysis and search within Hubspot.,,
The free HubSpot photos sound great,,
"Although is very complete, it lacks some (of what I consider) essential resources in Social Media Tools, such as multiple image posting on Instagram, redifining shared image on link posts on Facebook, stories for Instagram and others.",,
when uploading photos to website can be hard to figure out what ones you have uploaded in the back end before you publish it.,,
SO slow that I have to stop using it.,,
"When using it inside something like Station, it can sometimes logout without you realizing it.",,
One of the harder things to deal with is to know where to start and what to do.,,
The pricing structure is very rigid.,,
"For example, sometimes working with custom forms or trying to make changes to global templates gets glitchy and confusing.",,
There are also a lot of errors and speed issues during key points of the quarter.,,
"Hubspot is a good CRM overall, the pricing can improve but other than that there are little to no issues.",,
"The portal and software can sometimes be a little glitchy, but with so many different things working at the same time, it's to be expected.",,
"The reporting tool is good and allow you to have a good overview, but if you want more in-depth analysis, it is not necessarily easy to do.",,
Different pricing structures for different sides of the platform.,,
"I appreciated a lot the Competition Analysis tool, which is no more included.",,
The advanced menus in their website editing tool is tricky.,,
The email templates are pretty basic and not friendly for all mail servers.,,
I am still learning HubSpot and all of its powerful applications.,,
but that's the same with any product,,
"We still haven't worked out how to work around this and attribute $ in to their HubSpot contact record, which makes ROI pretty difficult to determine.",,
I haven't been able to use Chat Support for some time now.,,
Wish the workflow functionality was built out to be a little bit more robust at a base level so not as many workarounds were necessary.,,
"Also, the screen seems a little glitchy going between old and new editors.",,
"Also, HubSpot updates the platform so often it's sometimes hard to keep up with changes.",,
But I appreciate that they make the legacy tools available for awhile after new updates are in effect.,,
"As I mentioned, there have been times that I have some buggy issues with formatting, testing, setting up pages.",,
"it's impossible to AB test a workflow or easily redirect users from one place in workflow to another, so sometimes You need to arduously copy the same actions in different branches of workflow.",,
"The Design tool is quite complicated, I have to contact the support team very often.",,
Some of their best products are now free but tend to be limited.,,
"Hubspot just released that integration, so I'm a happy camper.",,
It would be nice to have more options for drag and drop.,,
Their emails templates leave something to be desired visually.,,
"This includes representing the various deal stages with certain colors that make sense (closed is green, lost is red, etc.)  ",,
"Also, their pricing is based on the # of contacts you store, which means the cost will keep increasing as long as you are growing your contact database.",,
"If you have a small company, while their free CRM is a good value, investing in the entire platfom may not be advisable without the proper staffing to work it.",,
"They often decide what we should be paying attention to, rather than our own needs (Keyword tool).  ",,
There are not many things to dislike!,,
"Pricing based on contacts, not suitable for all organisations, Wished their CMS would not have their own HUBL language.",,
"sure the classes they hold every once in awhile would be a tremendous help but they are kind of pricey and the company doesn’t really have the budget to send me for a weekend. 
",,
I haven't extensively used the product to face any dislikes as yet.,,
I like everything so far.,,
"Additionally, it's hard to measure the impact of an email in terms of form fills it drove as that data lives at the landing page level.",,
"Despite this, HubSpot does have an integration with AdStage that includes Twitter and Youtube ads that our CSM brought to our attention. 
",,
Some of the platforms can be very simple and rigid which limits creativity and ends with a very boxy feel to pages.,,
From time to time HubSpot crashes.,,
Still have to better understand the differences when I prepare reports.,,
"However, the team is often keen to help and hears you.",support:UX,
I have to manually update change to each contact instead of updating the entire sheet with changes.,Actionable:updates:bugs,
An option to add a deal whilst adding a contact would be much more efficient.,,
"That was one of the only limitations - it made it hard to keep track of your emails, and basically forced you to stick with GMail.",,
Their help chat is very responsive and helpful but spending more time or multiple practical demos would be helpful.,,
Once I adopted the new layout I was able to work normally.,,
"There are pieces of web analytics (like goals, page performance, etc) that are really lacking.",,
There are several technical areas that can be improved upon or implemented that are pretty basic in terms of a typical marketer's day-to-day reporting and workflow needs.,,
Not being able to group-edit social posts once scheduled is a major one.,,
I also recommend having a heatmap tool to evaluate our landing pages.,,
Complex workflows are not possible (cannot reference fields with tokens in workflows).,,
"We are very content with the service, but would’ve liked to know what features would come at a higher cost.",,
There are limitations that we've run into with the way workflows are set up.,,
"Just begun year 2, I am trying to make a fresh start. 
",,
"I know absolutely no coding, so it's really frustrating.",,
"Many functions are locked because of free (which is very understandable though) , but it somehow makes the startups company will search the other tool to replace hubspot.",,
The platform is built for B2C sales which makes the CRM difficult to use for a B2B company.,,
"It seems to not pull keywords even if they are in the title of what you are looking for. 
",,
"I guess my only complaint would be when trying to open a report or file in our File Manager section, it will not open the article/file directly into a PDF.",,
Some features seem to be limited.,,
I could clone groups of rules and then just adjust a property or two.,,
"While Hubspot is a great all in one marketing tool, the email system is not great.",,
"While HubSpot's landing and blog pages work, I tend to default to simpler tools.",,
"If you're expecting to build out robust workflows, most of the time you'll have to enroll contacts into other workflows as it lacks advanced automation features.",,
Channel source reporting specific data becomes significantly less exact when we stopped hosting our site on HubSpot's UI.,,
The only thing I can think of is that we cannot schedule videos for business,,
Another thing is that you're only allowed a limited amount of brand domains.,,
There really isn't anything I dislike about HubSpot.,,
"However, the HubSpot Community is a free way to get answers to webpage development questions!",,
"While it is inviting for marketers who are new to automation, it has limitations for veteran automation experts that live and die by Salesforce.com data.",,
"As an expert product, you must to have a lot of technicals knowledges, even if you have it, you must to be upgraded to new words for understand some features.",,
Sometimes Hubspot makes things a little too simplified and doesn't show you the nuts and bolts of what you are trying to do.,,
"A veces hay que estar pendiente al momento de registrar un correo para un contacto, ya que el hubspot lee el outlook o cualquier otra dirección que",,
That is the biggest thing that holds me back in HubSpot.,,
"With the amount of content my company has on Hubspot, some of the graphs and charts become a little less meaningful and harder to read.",,
"The social media tool does not allow me to schedule video at this stage, not can I tag pages in the photos or add locations tags yet.",features:Actionable:wishes,
Analytics are comprehensive but are not as flexible as is Google Analytics.,,
"There isn't a method to it -it's random whether hubspot keeps the information or clears it, and then I have to go into the property history and copy paste all of the checkbox options back in - sometimes this is 5+ options checked.",,
"Needs multiple dependent fields
",,
More manual checking.,,
I wish there was a map feature where we could see our prospects on a map.,,
"Some of their offerings are lacking, but it's difficult to customize for what you need.",,
"There are ways to manually calculate this based on other tracked metrics, however, those are also not available features.",,
"Every time I want to try something different, I seem to have to create a new template.",,
There are some analytics that I have to log into the actual social media account to see.,,
"We have been using the tool for 3 years now and have not yet utilized the depths of Hubspot, for better and for worse.",,
"In instances like that, it would make it easier to leave notes in the calendar talking about posts you made outside of Hubspot to keep yourself organized.  ",,
This is unfortunate when you have unique business needs that are not exactly met with the program as is but they have so many other functionalities that they can usually find you a workaround until they create a new solution.,,
The onboarding process has been slow and learning curve steep.,,
I don't think HubSpot integrates will with Salesforce.,,
I don't like that you cannot create email sequences for free and have to pay for that service.,,
"Overall a great platform, but I am fairly new to it.",,
This software is also easy ot learn which means a developer can easily learn this in a less time which also save the developer time which is a good thing for the developer and client aslo which means if a client gives a project to fresher on this software a developer can easily learn this and develop a site a less time.,,
"Chat functionality lacks in some areas, good enough but would ideally like better flexibility when it comes to assigning chat flows to agents and controlling chat flows assigned to agents that are busy.",,
It is somewhat hard to find my ads on Facebook ads.,,
There are some improvements Hubspot could make,,
"I have had my issues with Hubspot, but their team is devoted to customer satisfaction and everything gets sorted out very quickly.",,
"The content management system is challenging to understand coming from a WordPress background; however, HubSpot offers excellent training resources here and unlimited customer support.",,
I've only been using their simple free features.,,
"Tool is clunky, and it is hard to export raw data reports.",,
managing your clients is very tough without this kind of software,,
It would be nice if HubSpot could bring those over as well.,,
"If you've ever been saddled with a dead tool that never updates and stays current with technology, you won't experience that here.",updates,
"Firstly, many tools that are integrated into one bucket at HubSpot are individually available for free.",,
"The same features which are all we used in Desktop the same features not available in Mobile Version,off course its there but tightened with admin rights.",,
Usually the program auto-saves at some point,,
"In the past, there were a few bugs in the system, but their support team is responsive and helpful.",,
All their content is helpful too!,,
Some of the navigation and formatting functions are clunky.,,
"There are some issues to be fixed with coding, something most of the members of our team are unfamiliar with.",UX:bugs,
"We found we could not do some basic features we had available from a HubSpot competitor, and these shortcomings ultimately drove us away from the platform altogether.",,
Once you start to integrate HubSpot you need to change all platforms to be HubSpot compatible.,,
"It also overwrites contact data without notifying you (because users of the site input the information themselves), but HubSpot doesn't give an explanation when it does happen and how it can be fixed.",,
"When you have a lot of generic email addresses (@gmail, @outlook, etc.)",,
This is a technicality.,,

Integration with Salesforce could be improved.,,
"Nothing too drastic, but sometimes certain tools or functions move to a different tab or just get a face lift..",,
The only thing to dislike really is the cost.,,
It is limited to companies that are composed of advanced marketing teams.,,
A/B testing is very limited and emails are sent in bulk with little regard to sending limits and being marked as spam.,,
When you’re sending a one on one email to a contact of spot has ability to have a library of email templates at your disposal.,,
"Many of our clients use Salesforce, and the fact that SFDC works on the account level while Hubspot is on the contact level, mainly, makes the integration harder.",Actionable:integrations,
There are elements of the platform that proves difficult when adding contacts and mapping field.,,
"In addition to the landing pages you may host your website on HubSpot too, allowing you to personalize the content.

It wastes time.,,
"Therefore, it has some limits when you want to use it for account-based marketing.",,
"The organization of the Design Manager was easier to use when they launched than now after the ""improvements.""",,
Email rules are cumbersome.,,
"While a great thing about this tool is that it's constantly improving and developing, that can also be a downside when large-scale updates are made from the developers' end.",,
They have Customer Success Manager to ensure us gain our purposes and goals.,,
MOZ cannot crawl our site after SSL site,,
The system can be slow when it gets busy and the certifications change too frequently.,,
Can't tag people in LinkedIn & Facebook like you can with Twitter.,,
The reporting capabilities are all extra and that's not worth it - it should be included without question.,,
Hubspot is expensive when used to its full potential due to the cost of storing contacts.,,
"However, that is the tradeoff for powerful tools -- there's a learning curve.",,
and I did not leverage the capabilities.,,
Hubspot could control cookies generated from Google Tag Manager.,,
Or at least a good user manual on where to find things in HubSpot.,,
to generate interactive reporting.,,
"I like the level of viewing you have, so our whole team can see what everyone else is doing internally.",,
I still rely on Google Analytics for a lot of reporting.,,
The chat and support functions are super helpful and robust.,,
"and I received no help, instead just ""oh no, that's how it pulls."" 
",,
"but it can all add up, although it does incentivize you to make sure you are making full use of the software and that's only a good thing for your business.",,
The pricing structure is very confusing and you need to buy different packs to use their functions.,,
The reports aren't always easy to build and it can be a challenge to download reports in a way that makes sense.,,
The blatant upsell insistence.,,
(NZ is a day ahead of the rest of the world,,
"Also, the reporting seems to be getting better but it's hard to track customer upsell leads with their reporting tools that are based on lifecycle stages.",,
You can only tag company pages.,,
(This is probably a good thing!),,
"Also, some content elements take longer than expected to implement on the site.",,
I think Hubspot gives impossible goals so that people funnel more money into it without seeing the return they deserve.,,
"You can negotiate the first few years of the contract to be relatively cost efficient, but costs quickly increase after the initial contract period.",,
It is not a great overall sales tool compared to SalesForce.,,
It can be overwhelming and a lot to take in as far as the capabilities and software functionality.,,
Usability of the tools is great and permanently improved.,,
Could it grow our business to the level that we were promised?,,
"For a company that centres itself on customer experience, it should be obvious that when a customer comes through with an issue, they blurt out the whole issue first.",,
Hubspot's reporting isn't quite up to snuff with competitors.,,
I would like to include manually contacts to campaigns.,,
Not having enough time to take their Hubspot Academy classes.,,
I have not had any issues with HubSpot so far while using it.,,
Also when I first started using HubSpot I was a little confused.,,
"Thankfully, they are great with communications and send monthly video updates talking about improvements.",updates:support,
this is something they are already working on.,,
"The issue this creates is that for certain services, your monthly fee is determined by how many contacts you have stored in the CRM.",,
"There's still a room for improvement in all the areas, specifically in Social Media like every great tool.",,
"I want data that is a little more granular.

"Hubspot sells itself as a very customizable solution, but it's not very customizable.",,
so I don't fully utilise this function.,,
I often feel limited when using Hubspot.,,
"I'm not sure if this is Hubspot in particular, or just the nature of CRMs, but it's been a little confusing to understand how the data fields sync up when you import.     ",,
Would be nice to have a universal search feature for within workflows.,,
The WYSIWYG editor isn't always as flexible as what you'd like; Pricing gets high very fast; No a-la-carte options.,,
I dislike that the best features cost a lot of money.,price,
"If you choose Hubspot, I'll use the power of automation.",,
"I wish the de-duplicate tool for both the contacts and companies was more accurate -  sometimes the program identifies contacts with the same last name as duplicates, even if its a family run business.",,
There are not many customization options.,,
There could be some more features to work more efficiently.,,

"After doing some research we have actually realized that this information is actually not accurate, so Hubspot is now is the process of fixing this issue.",,
I honestly don't have anything that I dislike.,,
"I wish I could do that through Hubspot, although I am sure there is a coding reason behind that limitation.",,
"Due to the large number of functions that this tool has, the learning curve is high until you can get used to it.",,
"There isn't much to dislike, but I wish the conversation feature was a part of the marketing hub rather than sales.",,
There is one thing I actually cannot stand about HubSpot.,,
(Hubspot only allows use of images that are 4mp or less.),,
So far it has been easy to navigate,,
As a business we need more control over users like restricting access outside office.,,
Data security.,,
price is high but there are a lot of features we don't use that i think would bring more value,,
"The biggest frustration I have is that when creating a social media post from scratch you can choose which of the connected accounts the post will go to, but when you customize social posts from a blog article you cannot choose, its all default or nothing.",,

Steady change of platform template -,,
The support is top notch as well!,,

"The cost of add-ons can add up for a small business, but they're worth it if you know how to truly optimize the tool for your goals/industry.",,

If you're a small company it can be tough to use every part of the tool.,,

It doesn't always work well when I'm trying to integrate with other software and I get an error message.,,

I dislike that customer service can be slow and uneducated on the platform depending who I talk to.,,

"While the lessons and learning curses are helpful, it's still quite a process.",,
There is no equivalent at HubSpot.,,
Hubspot can give  access to what are the rights used from desktop access those are all permissions can be accessed in mobile sign in also.,,
I think if they were to enhance the CRM and the reporting functionality that the HubsSpot product would be top notch.,,
we are currently looking at our overall budget and will most likely join these folks in the next quarter...,,
"If you ever do have an issue, their support team is always able to solve issues in a timely manner.",,
Some of these are minor quibbles and might be more indicative of the field I work in.,,
Data centralization is not well defined in HubSpot.,,
There are also times when features can be found in one place but a week later and without warning they move somewhere else ÿ often with more clicks involved — which makes the UI frustrating at times.,,
"uX could be better

"With the CMS tool, HubSpot could have given many more templates in it's marketplace.",,
Would have liked that Hubspot employ a more mainstream coding language like Ruby or GoLang.,,
List/field management can be a bit tricky.,,
It's not very user friendly - if you are new it might take a while to understand the tool.,UX,

"I try and plan a week ahead, and at least two posts a day.",,
But one does still realize that this is a US company when it comes to features.,,
"We work with niche clients and the workflows for all of them will be the same, it would save us countless hours to be able to duplicate those across accounts instead of having to reinvent the wheel for each client.",,
I had to use the browser.,,

No visual mapping tools for organizing and diagramming automation campaign flows.,,
There are some features and tools that are missing that seem like no brainers.,,
It does always seem to be more efficient eventually,,
It makes it clunky to have to go in to schedule the same blog to be tweeted at a different time.,,
A lot of these suggestions are implemented to the platform ongoingly.,,
"Maybe web developers can but I, as a Digital Marketing practitioner, would like to explore it more so I can use Hubspot to fully.",,
Sometimes the email templates can be a little clunky and not as customizable as I'd like.,,

Simple blue blocks.,,

A suggestions section that pops up would be nice.,,

Creating custom landing page templates is not very user-friendly.,,
"Me gustaría ver más certificaciones, aunque las que hay",,
"I've only used the tool for about 3 months, but so far any time I thought it couldn't do something, it just turned out I was looking in the wrong place.",,
It was a complex issue to address,,
"For example, the blog template is great to standardize things, but it can be hard to make large individual changes to specific blog posts.",,
It has been a complete disaster and has taken over a week for Husbpot to take responsibility in fixing the error.,,
There's nothing significant that I disdain.,,
but they always catch it up,,
Would have liked to have HubSpot dedicated support to help with that.,,
The communication functionality is clunky compared to Gmail.,,
Some people have a hard time using it.,,
"Also, if you CC someone, it seems to get confused and can't track who exactly is opening it.",,
"If I could specify which contact properties to include, it would cut down on the payload significantly.",,
"That once you merge a contact or a company, there is no possibility to go back.",,
"For a family business, that is really frustrating.",,
"It's one of those things that would be amazing for some companies, but our company has many seperate legs that we are in charge of.",,
"The good news is that the HubSpot team has a new release almost every month, and there is an online forum.",,
If they could mimic the AdWords UI a bit more that would be helpful.,,
"Finally, it has been difficult to implement the email suppression tool because when it suppresses an email, it never sends it out.",,
Would love if prospect tool that identifies anonymous companies coming to the site actually lived in the marketing platform instead of the CRM.,,
"The automation tool often requires multiple workflow to set routine tasks, the lack of the tags and the few options are the principal issues in my job.",,
When I first began using HubSpot I felt that everyone I talked to was knowledgeable and helpful,,
"we are a start up and do not have lots of complex campaigns put in place yet and HubSpot is working  just fine managing our flows.
",,
but they may not be the same for whatever reason.,,
You can't post videos to Instagram on the social media scheduling feature.,,
I wish the workflows had an auto-unenroll option when someone responded similarly to the sequences.,,
The social reporting and publishing function could definitely be more robust.,,
Layering search terms on top of one another to filter down is useful but can be complicated.,,
"However, these are things that might be fixed through working with my marketing director.",,
The method for building the landing pages is very archaic.,,
I have too many issues and I get fed up using the application.,,
I am not such a fan of some of the decisions around pricing of the solution and the integration between Sales Pro and core Hubspot could be better.,,
The only reasons I've heard moving away from HubSpot is if your business reaches an undesired level of complexity for managing business rules around your marketing - not a desired place to be but some businesses may be there.,,
so I'm very thankful for the trial run to help me make a decision on if this is something I want to continue to use for my freelance writing and blogging endeavors.,,
"It's good that they are always updating the site, but right as I get used to doing things one way they come out with a new layout or look and throw me off.",,
Synchronization of outlook on MAC does not work with HubSpot.,,
The organization is awesome.,,
"I worked at a nonprofit that use Hubspot to manage clients, donors, volunteers, etc.",,
"I loved the tasks but some of them asked me to create a new campaign and now as I use the CRM, these silly fake tasks that I had to make are still in there.",,
"After taking several of their classes,  I feel some of the content gets very repetitive.",UX:support,
"It does not allow me to send to multiple emails, you are forced to send one at a time.",wishes:Actionable:features,
"Sending less than 10k emails, and sync breaks -- there's no solution other than clumsy workarounds that will cost us more time.",,
"Hubspot has an open API that does enable communication, but the support is limited and in cases ineffective.",,
I understand HubSpot's content philosophy has moved away from keywords,,
"Overall, I love HubSpot but there are a few 'HubSpot-isms' that I think could be improved upon.",,
"However, HubSpot do such a fantastic job of keeping you in the loop, that it really isn't an issue.",,
Because of this I still have to use Klaviyo to run all of our cart abandonment and stock replenishment campaigns because I can't accurately/ automatically filter products based upon the customers buying history,,
"We felt we were led to believe that we would receive a higher level of support, particularly within the back-end tools for website and eDM dev work, than what was available in reality.",,
Hubspot is missing very basic functionality and features.,,
"Too many of the features are also add-ons, like Reporting (I think Reporting is an essential enough feature that it should just be included with every price level!)",,
I don't know if have any dislikes at this time.,,
Nothing major to dislike has jumped out yet.,,
The downsides to hubspot is that it doesn't let you upload videos to instagram and the amount of photos you can upload to one post are limited.,,
This software is a bit pricey.,,
I feel like they should be deleted once the certification is complete!,,
"Also, ideas in the community that should really be implemented are slow to show up, but that probably makes sense with how you can't rush programming.",UX,
"And on the social media front, it doesn't always display as nicely as I would like.",,
"The software is easy to use, I love how quickly I can import contacts and add them to sequences. 
",,
And when you do reach a roadblock - customer support is always there.,,
mostly of them could be automatic to give the admin a report...,,
"HubSpot can put you in a design block, which can be hard to truly make your website feel and look how you want it to.",,
Please remove that from this survey to make it better and easier to complete.,wishes:UX:Actionable,
Just here for the information.,,
I think you can get the same education and tools elsewhere for a lesser cost.,,
"All things considered with that being my only qualm, I'd say they're doing pretty darned good.",,
it looses al,,
"The web design integration platform they use is complex, bulky, inefficient, and not user friendly.",,
It's difficult if you do not have coding experience and you can't adjust many of the fonts to help with your own branding.,,
The HubSpot Acadamy videos tend to teach you more about how to do their style of marketing and don't focus enough on the technical details of using their system.,,
"I don't like when some of the bugs pop up and HubSpot gets glitchy, but it is very rare, and it's usually fixed with a browser refresh.",,
"Admittedly, Hubspot has been improving over the past 18 months, fixing many annoyances, but it still lacks a solid flow.  
",,
"Also, I particularly don’t like the landing page by default",,
The financial update is unavailable to be synced with SaasOptic so you can't automatically track payment history.,,
"Moving LP/website pages back to content staging, make options more interchangeable i.e. switching the list between static to active, automated to follow-up email, staged page from unmodified to new page vice versa.",,
Pretty tough learning curve.,,
The price for premium members could be lowered a bit.,,
Sometimes responsiveness of system is a little slow.,,
I know how to use the software,,
The dashboard is a bit confusing and pricey for the paid accounts.,,
Can't switch between email type.,,
"Once you start using the tools and get dependent on it, you keep exploring other add ons.",,
It would be nice if information flowed through all the way to the deal.,,
"Hubspot > Salesforce integration can be buggy and complicated, but wonderful when it's done correctly.",integrations,
The team makes their templates and sequences private to avoid people using and accidentally changing templates they've both together.,,
I also wish that I could see deeper SEO trends and best practices.,,
"Getting certificates can take time (i.e. watching the tutorials/modules, doing exercises and taking the final exams).",UX:support,
"For example, if you want to combine reporting for two campaigns at the same time, good luck!",,
You can get pretty detailed in analytics and reporting in Hubspot but perhaps not as much as Marketo.,,
We did a trial and cancelled it.,,
I wish there was better reporting offered for nurture campaigns and workflows.,,
it's format.,,
his email is wrong.,,
Lack of support for third party CRMs or for API support.,,
Sometimes it would randomly disconnect our Gmail from Hubspot and wouldn't inform us that all of our emails hadn't been sent and it would take hours to go back and re-enroll our contacts in those sequences...,Actionable:bugs:features,
Pricing is also a bit steep.,price,
Sometimes HubSpot implements aesthetic updates that take a bit of time to get used to.,,
We also use Salesforce as an integrated CRM and the numbers hardly ever match up.,,
I dislike the ability to make phone calls directly from the CRM without high fees attached.,,
Sometimes it is difficult to navigate a new template...,,
but that is really it.,,
"GDPR has been arranged for, and they are investing in multi-language capabilities.",,
There is not a whole like that,,
"Design Tools for email creation is a bit confusing to use, if you're not familiar.",,
There are some limitations to the reporting function.,,
It was sometimes tough to navigate through the design manager and the page builder when you're trying to debug an issue on a landing page or email.,UX:bugs:Actionable,
Segmentation is a error-prone process....,,
"Since there are so many features and functions on the website, it definitely will take some time to learn everything on Hubspot.",,
"Which, as we know, not all e-mails load pictures in all settings.",,
I thought the organization of the Admin dashboard was difficult to navigate at first but taking the Marketing Fundamentals three-day in-person training helped to connect the dots.,,
It just took me two weeks to get a contact to receive our emails again after she was placed into the unengaged contacts workflow.,,
It has sometimes been difficult to work on the same project as a team at the same time because of updating issues.,bugs:updates,
have to clear cache to use phone dialer reliably,,
Expensive and their landing page design feature is horrible,,
While their core software is great,,
Also landing pages and forms are easy to create.,,
It's hard to track the entire lifecycle of leads in a visual way,,
And you have to be a coder to edit the templates.,,
Some features do not seem fully developed.,,
"Various option  like calls,emails ,scheduling meetings ,appointments ,creating to-dos ,are its key features .
",,
HubSpot is not cheap.,,
"It is not integrated with CRM, which makes dealing with the third party partners difficult.",,
Sometimes you need some html knowledge to fix small issues like line breaks and such.,,
I don't want to bug them if they're working on it,,
"However, it's never been anything that has slowed us down.",,
Also to have project templates on deals so that deals and projects could be better linked.,,
The email creator is limited in creativity and has difficulty being consistent.,,
Setting up the system is so easy but there are many many tools to setup and track...,,
"It's not a dislike, more of an improvement - a scheduling diary for blogs would be really useful.",,
For that reason we have had to get a little creative with structure.,,
HubSpot Support were not able to provide support in this area so we had to spend $s on hiring an external website developer to assist with new website build.s,,
"There are a lot of features, but cost creep can jump out at you when you need to pay for different necessary features separately.",,
There is nothing I really dislike.,,
Hubspot does need some custom coding every once in a while that can slow down our processes.,,
It doesn't actually work for any started purpose unless you pay for the most advanced tier.,,
"In general there are a lot of odds and ends that come up and make you think """,,
"I love HubSpot, I'm really into it and promote them with friends...",,
One being you're not able to import unique images into an email.,,
"Me encantaría que además de las guías existieran videos para ayudarnos a los usuarios que tenemos poco tiempo utilizando esta herramienta, o aprendices.",,
It is a little nerve wrecking to know what one you import fields that they could be permanently over-written.,,
so I'm happy to cut them some slack.,,
"Very few I do not like, I would like a style a little more adaptable in the reports.",,
Using Twitter lists in the channel is much more effective.,,
"With how easy of a tool to use and understand, it's also got some limitations.",,
but I would be forced to pay that.,price,
social media interactions) and on the platform itself.,,
"Well I can, but I will have to code it.",,
"Unless they get starter, which has been improved, obviously, but it still does not include everything a young marketing company would need to get started.",,
Neither issue is mission critical.,,
"They are always staying up to date and current on how marketing is rapidly evolving and making adjustments to their database to help, while keeping you informed through their blog.",,
Some of these additional features should be implemented in HubSpot's system.,,
I dislike the fact that some of HubSpot's features are not that obvious.,,
they way we have designed.,,
Very bad connection with Salesforce.com -,,
We've had issues trying to sync contacts after email sends.,bugs:Actionable:features,
I still don't know how to update someone's email address.,,
"While it is worth it for my business, it is pretty pricey.",price,
I feel like the only drawback with Hubspot is that it is SO inclusive and intelligent that it can be overwhelming to learn for a new user.,,
"It cost a big amount of money and could improve in some integrations with the web design part; however, it's all good.  
",,
No flexible contract.,,
"It doesn't happen consistently, but can be annoying when it does.",,
Wish there was more flexibility in changing design/layout directly in a page as opposed to creating new templates for every different layout.,,
"HS guys a nice, which does go a long way but at the end of the day it's MQL rev and branding results.",,
Saying each tool is not user friendly is an understatement.,,
"The social media management function has very limited capabilities, but I feel I'm tied to it for campaign tracking purposes.",,
It would be great if there was a way to easily see posts on each day for the week.,,
"While my time on the platform was spent using its blogging tool, I couldn’t help but notice how Hubspot offers ways to streamline and monitor your marketing and sales activities. 
",,
Some of the most robust features aren't made available to smaller startups that don't need the Enterprise level.,,
Even when I come across issues they have an awesome support team to help you get the help you need via phone or text chat,,
"We were not able to bring HubSpot Sales as complement of MKT hub because of policies, they do not sign  NDAs, just their mutal NDA and that was an obstacle for us to move on and have a more robust strategy.",,
They have their own coding language and you have to know it to do deeper customization.,,
"I can not find something that displeases me of HubSpot, it is a great software that works great, I have nothing negative to say towards this incredible tool.",,
The older elements can be clunky and confusing.,,
"HubSpot analytics reporting can at times be confusing, and I wish there were more ways to create ads within HubSpot.",,
"As we all know, the tool is essential, but it's how you and your colleagues are using it that matters. 
",,
I haven’t figured out if there’s an easier way to get rid of it other than deleting after it’s been scheduled.,,
I don't personally have that much that I dislike about it.,,
"If you're like me, you will start using the templates, but coding knowledge is required in order to match your visual chart.",,
Sometimes you have to completely exit out of Hubspot when you make a change.,,
The automation needs work.,,
"Pricing may be higher for small and medium companies but if they want to target only large organizations, then it is different but for the beginners, Hubspot may be a little bit difficult to use.",,
I wish hubspot had more Ecommerce and payment processing functionality,integrations:wishes:features:Actionable,
HubSpot automatically resizes all images in order to maximize speed when posted but the image quality is drastically reduced in this process.,,
"Reporting is also limited, as far as trying to go from a high level view to a single post view, looking at information at aggregate and trying to get a holistic sense of how your content is performing with the metrics you care about - a lot of these tools are challenging to navigate and inflexible.",,
There are a few bugs but nothing a page refresh cant fix.,,
I understand that because those platforms are external to HubSpot that there are only certain features that can be implemented.,,
There's not as much connection to social media as I wish there was.,,
"The price is very high when compared to similar products, such as the Zoho suite, that are rapidly approaching the same functionality as HubSpot, for 1/10th of the monthly cost.",,
"It would take far less time to create all of the emails needed to just clone existing emails and edit with drag/drop than have to pick a template, clone it if there's a slight change, and then adjust all of the default copy.
",,
I expect more customizations to happen on every level in this tool.,,
it’s more like there’s just so mch available that it takes time to adapt.,,
In the past with website redesigns we have had difficulty with making minor changes that totally end of messing up the whole website.,,
we leverage an additional tool.,,
Hubspot is not built for nonprofits.,,
Some things are a bit difficult to find and under odd categories.,,
in one spot.,,
"The reporting has gotten better, but it could still use more work at being intuitive.",,
Making calls out of Hubspot proved to be glitchy and regularly got complaints that the service was choppy,,
"Additionally, the interface caused hitches as it wasn’t always convenient.",,
and I consider expensive to get template for changing it.,,
"You can A/B test, but not with automated emails, making it a virtually useless feature for our organization.  
",UX:Actionable:wishes:features,
"It's very clunky and slows down the website (if you use it as a CMS), I'm always coming across small bugs, and it's limited with regards to how your web pages can look (limited templates available).  ",,
Don't even get me started on the other lead gen tools which have the utmost basic functionality.,,
There are lot of options and it sometimes feels very overwhelming to have all of that laid out at once.,,
Nothing really but more advancement sould be carryed out as time goes on,,
There is not much to dislike about hubspot except the steep learning curve when switching over to hubspot.,,
I'd love to purchase certain features a-la-carte.,,
It's a really expensive system but it does represent great value for money when you compare the features.,,
However it's easy to correct and republish.,,
so I can find older versions in the revisions section.,,
Could look at adding drop and drag email building feature to landing / blog / web pages,,
no es tan difícil.,,
Not intuitive enough; some features like integration with Outlook Contacts which should be Standard,,
"Also, it costs very high to integrate CRM with HubSpot.",integrations:price,
"They are growing, and with growth comes software changes and updates.",,
I also suggest having more modules available in the marketplace.,,
"Also, the navigation seems to move around sometimes.",,
Integration to GoToWebinar is a little cumbersome - I have to remember to go and click the checkbox to sync-up the sign-ups.,,
"I do not love the technical issues that comes up, although it is very rare.",,
"With video content growing in importance for our marketing strategy, it's becoming harder to measure our social engagement because we currently can't track that in HubSpot.
",,
I dislike their customer support.,,
"Some features are limited, as well as it can be expensive for smaller teams with small budgets.",,
Forms also aren't the most customizable in the design sense.,,
"Sometimes the photos publish incorrectly, with something cropped off that shouldn't be, and you don't know until it's already been published and you see it (on the preview it looks fine).",,
"Basically they sent an email 7 days before, and 1 day before account DELETION, both of which went to spam.
",,
but once you build out a template you like,,
"Then, once you buy that, the process repeats.  ",,
The website builder is also very unintuitive.,,
"As with any software program, there will be glitches but the customer support is on top of any issues or concerns, which is above and beyond most these days.
",,
"I can look at both separately but not together, which often results in several time frame adjustments to get these results. 
",,
Coding LP is a pain for our developer and support tends to me limited on anything that you customize.,,
"When all was said and done, we could have purchased a higher end platform for about the same cost.",price,
"For example, when we onboard someone on our product, they go through a signup flow and ideally we would like to use the Hubspot API to move this person through the pipeline.",,
but it’s not the option you need.,,
I also don’t like that booking a meeting cannot be used as a trigger in workflows.,,
"This is fine for anyone newer to marketing automation but if you've work with any of the other good systems, HubSpot is a downgrade because you're limited in what you can do. 
",,
My biggest gripe is not being able to schedule video or carousel posts to Instagram.,features:Actionable:wishes,
you get to use some really excellent features such as sales pro up and contacts up to a limit before it then gets really costly to increase capacity.,,
but the most important thing to look at is how the support service deal with cases/tickets.,,
"This is great for very basic reporting (open, click rates) but this isn't 2008 anymore.",,
Would there be an example where too many workflows or a specific type of workflow might not be worth using.,,
"Although, I do believe it's worth every penny.",,
Nothing much to dislike.,,
There is nothing wrong to add about Hubspot.,,
"Currently, we have a few workaround in place that allow us to do what we need to. 
",,
and you can't report on them in HubSpot via a funnel.,,
It would be nice if the user could build their own dashboards from available data and not just rely on the pre-fabricated ones that Hubspot provides.,,
"Also, the limit of workflows one can create.",,
At first it was hard to navigate but it has gotten easier with time.,,
Their Calls to Action feature also always shows up blurry rendering it basically useless.,,
vague organization of the training courses,,
I'd like the ability to customize each color down to the specific type in the legend so I can make the chart more intuitive for our purposes.,,
The Salesforce integration is very useful but would love to be able to integrate into other solutions.,,
"Sometimes the social integration can get a bit wonky with previews, but generally it's more an issue with the  chosen images for landing pages.",,
Project management is one of the few tools my department uses other software for even though most tasks involve Hubspot.,,
"For the most part HubSpot integrates into the majority of CRMs, but like any tool, implementation can take some work.",,
"The free version of Hootsuite is more comprehensive when it comes to community management. 
",,
"I dislike the fact that my contacts threshold only increases, but never decreases.  ",,
There is a lot of bifurcation of tiered features that you have to request to be unlocked.,,
Sometimes it's been clunky.,,
There are SO MANY features...,,
"It is built for very simple use, unless you want to buy outside templates.",,
What is one of the most important metrics for email marketers?,,
I dislike it because it does not have a lot of features,,
This has a lot of limitations when the company offers b2b services.,,
"Building some reports can be difficult, I need to get a hubspot property of when a contact completes a form or pop up.",,
"If I ever come across a problem, their support has been great at helping me fix it/find a solution.",,
"That said, if you don't do it exactly as outlined, you might run into issues (like going out of order when building Ikea furniture.",,
"I have made 1 suggestion to allow Ads dashboards to be manipulated, also I'd like to download all my ads reports from the Ads campaigns dashboard. 
",,
I wish the responsiveness of the pages was automatically built in without having to create smart rules.,,
"but there are none, there should be opportunities to change an email saved for automation back to a regular send email, you should be able to create a web link for an email in a regular send email not just an automated email",,
"The only feature our team dislikes is the messages feature, there is no ability to send screen shots through the chat when applied to our website.",features:Actionable:wishes:bugs,
I've had some pages not autosave,,
Also we would love to be able to personalize more and create different types of contacts and treat them different.,,
Switching back to nutshell clickfunnels and shopify,,
"The metrics dashboard allow us to have a very clear scenario about the success of our campaigns,",,
I spoke with the support specialist ONCE.,,
Being able to map our clients visually would greatly assist in our marketing flow in the future.,,
The only thing I would like to see is ability to write PHP or another server-side script.,,
"From time-to-time it can take a little while for metrics and data to be ""live"" or reflective of real-time.",,
The user interface is less than intuitive and recently HubSpot is pushing updates to add and remove features without notification to me as a user.,,
Certain features and reports are limited at times.,,
"Is integrated with my Gmail
",,
It's been such a huge improvement for our team.,,
"Applications like Eloqua and Marketo offer more flexibility in the creation of campaigns, but it comes at the expense of usability.",,
it's full possibility,,
"If not, I would love one to be created.",,
"I've had a number of frustrations with with getting the layout to work as i want, and generally the process of building emails is not as intuitive as something like Mail Chimp.",,
Often times things are 2-3 steps harder than they probably need to be.,,
One of the things I dislike is the speed of the Hubspot API.,,
It's overwhelming for a small company with no dedicated IT department.,,
"- The marketplace has templates you can use
",,
There are a lot of variables in your overall pricing.,,
"There are really just some minor optimizations I'd like to see, primarily to aid with daily navigation and hopping back and forth between different areas of the tool.",,
"For instance, you have to rely too much on simple if&then",,
The only thing that we have had trouble with in the past is using the design manager.,,
"I rather see any changes from template than under the ""website"".  ",,
"Aside from this issue with the new feature, I am very pleased with what I have used.",,
I have struggled with the duplicate removal feature a bit.,,
• Support is responsive and always prompt to help answer your inquiries.,,
"We signed the contract, we paid the bill.).  ",,
"It needs an internet connection to communicate and with people for using the HubSpot.
",,
The current model mimics the web version - which on the phone does not operate as expected.,,
We loved this platform.,,
I think more of a focus on improving the existing products over adding new ones would be helpful.,,
"when setting up workflows, so sometimes I have to wait quite a while for the system to update.",,
"I dislike the inability to post to Pinterest, Linkedin, Google+, and other popular platforms.",,
this would be easy if you could just create some DateDiff functions in the calculated fields.,,
That sometimes the tool can be inconsistent during use.,,
That you have to make a new template every time you want to add something simple like an extra text block.,,
"Again, it takes time to completely understand how the website building software works, especially if you are not as familiar with HTML or CSS coding.",,
We are very limited on what we can monitor and social engagement is huge for us.,,
"so I wanted just to skip the practical task, but in the end, I still had to complete it in order to get certified.",,
"You have to take some responsibility for organizing your dashboards in a way that's useful for you, which means you need to understand your goals and KPIs.",,
"Tech support has been completely useless altogether, I’ve never been able to manage my client email base.",,
If it was $100+ that would be tougher.,,
"I understand they're probably doing this to make it ""easier"" to understand, but it takes away a lot of insightful data at the same time.",,
It would be nice to edit the code on any template like you can in Marketo.,,
It seems a bit cluttered at times.,,
yes/,,
"(Marketing Automation workflows, Emails, Contacts, etc.)",,
"Un CRM che unisce marketing e sales
",,
There are too many things that you can do and this makes the experience a bit cluttered.,,
Having to submit cancellation notice 90 days prior to contract ending completely screwed me and locked me in to another year as their contracts are hard to fight.,,
"The length, but it is necessary to obtain all that knowledge.",,
"After you connect with HubSpot, you will get a lot of emails from HubSpot team members trying to sell you things, asking if you want additional information, etc.",,
I believe there is lot of room for more innovations.,,
The form function has limited functions and would be nice to be able to integrate Google Forms into the forms function and track analytics.,,
I am not a huge fan of the design functionality.,,
Maybe some help guides to utilize it better.,,
"The service in spanish can improve, the team needs better training with the tool.",,
It gets tedious sometimes.,,
"It would be great to be able to identify which leads were coming from Google Display vs. Search, and Facebook vs. LinkedIn.",,
They do need to find a way to allow for deal records to be updated via a workflow from the contact record.,,
The web site builder is very easy to use.,,
Thanks to great results it's gotten easier.,,
some team members find hard to keep their lead management up to date.,,
"For simple pages, it works well, but when you add many elements, it can get tricky to keep track of what elements you are moving around in the template.",,
This feels very discouraging to me while i try to access hubspot in mobile.,,
"However, you cannot use those email templates when sending out a mass email to a group of people.  ",features:wishes:bugs:Actionable,
"Additionally, since I am new, it is so nice to be able to plan ahead for the coming week!",,
"Moreover, if you want a separate tool for outbound marketing, HubSpot is very limited in integration with outbound email programs.",,
Not sure I can bring any negatives.,,
"Also great for web-based content offering and automation.
",,
Certain changes can have unforeseen impacts on other pages/emails and it's not always clear how to resolve them.,,
For advance users (developers) it's quite limited and you really need to think out of the box to fix issues that in other platforms (like Wordpress) would be easier to fix.,,
We rather just use the platform for additional segmentation and user journeys.,,
Analytics are sometimes off from what Google analytics says.,,
Another big annoyance is A/B testing.,,
Since we started using HubSpot in 2015 I have noticed a substantial improvement on almost all of the features we used on a regular basis as well as on a not-so-frequent basis.,,
"Also, by using contact emails we ran into issues where we would have duplicate companies when we imported new users from our software and since we used to have Salesforce connected, we could not merge them to clean up our companies.",,
but I like the Idea of one system for everything.,,
"There are so many different tools and ways to use HubSpot - which is great, but also creates a slight learning curve for new users.",,
- Hubspot keywords - Keywords analysis is also a tool I use every day.,,
Sometimes HS is sending me 2MB of data for a contact when I only need a small portion of that.,,
That I don't know everything about Hubspot because the software is a beast.,,
- it is better for inbound marketing but needs more tools to be an effective retargeting tool,,
I feel like the relationship would be better with a consistent point of contact.,,
SEO certification needs to happen!!,,
It can be overwhelming at first as there are a lot of options and a lot of ways to integrate a campaign.,,
I disliked the design manager tool.,,
Only thing I would say is that the reporting for the marketing platform could be improved.,,
There is nothing so far that I have found to dislike.,,
It would be helpful if it showed us a list of recipients that did not receive an email because they previously bounced before.,bugs:features:Actionable,
"You definitely need one dedicated user keep up with all of the inbound information and reporting features, although I struggle at times with downloading the correct reports.",,
Recently HubSpot changed their mobile app.,,
I find HubSpot to be a perfect application.,,
"Sometimes their updates take some time to adapt to, and I wish we had the choice to stay with some of the older versions.",,
"I believe it's a great platform for some people, but I didn't find it useful in my business.",,
Reporting capabilities aren't fully flushed out.,,
"If I had to choose, the only thing I dislike about HubSpot is that it is relatively expensive and potentially hard for smaller business to afford.",,
I have continued to rely on their support and insight and I will continue to consider their materials informative.,,
"And (for agency users), when they introduce a new feature, you get pop-ups about it in every portal instead of just one.",,
"Experiencing some downtime (not always Hubspot's fault - thanks Cloudflare), but not always the most reliable service.",,
"The sales tool is ""meh.""",,
"There are a few specific features that I am surprised Hubspot can't do--for example, when uploading a contact there isn't a way to prevent it from writing over old data--as a previous Eloqua user this was a feature I took for granted.",,
The reports are limited.,,
"I'm sure tracking works great for typical HubSpot clients; however, as a hospital, it has been very difficult.",,
"For traditional businesses, it makes more sense but if you have a huge contact list it gets very expensive very fast.",,
The capabilities and nuances of the tool require time and dedication to build out comprehensive marketing and sales processes.,,
"As long as you go through all of the tutorials, you will understand what to do next.",,
a few service outages which were obviously out of HubSpots control over the past year.,,
"Right now, templates from HubSpot are subpar, while those from independent users do not cover all the requirements.",,
Right now I feel like Facebook's interface still tackles managing a large volume of messages better,,
"There are very few things that I dislike about the system, but if I had to pick one is the ability for Hubspot to only sync with person and prospect records in Salesforce.",,
For example: not being able to A/B test when your webpage is translated into multiple languages.,,
Love features.,,
It is very easy to use and I have no problems using this wonderful tool.,,
"For example, can we over workflow?",,
Sometimes it is a bit complicated to navigate the tool which makes some of the features difficult to find.,,
"I would love for the platform to provide more customization capability, especially around the page templates.",,
I haven't found much I dislike about Hubspot.,,
I have had issues of posts populating on our social media channels a lot later than anticipated.,,
"Solid content management system, but not as good as WordPress.",,
"Fortunately, their support has been consistently receptive, helpful.",,
"The reporting can occasionally be a little hard to understand, but working with your account rep is very helpful.",,
Can be too simple.,UX,
It's also not a direct replacement for MailChimp.,,
This means I can't trust the numbers here and would never commit to a subscription and add metrics so I can make this my main reporting hub.,,
Or if you click back to contacts you lose your filter.,,
not very friendly in other languages / markets.,features:UX,
High price for really cruical functionalities like CMS and webhooks.,,
"Overall, the software isn't super intuitive, and I find myself asking for help or searching for answers pretty often.",,
Levels and pricing are a little confusing and expensive.,price,
I also think the calendar could be a lot more user friendly,,
But there are too many positives with HubSpot to say I dislike something in particular!,,
"They release new features often, but maybe some before they should have, as things can be a little buggy.",,
"For example, sometimes I will type multiple lines or paragraphs on an Instagram post, but all of the spaces between lines get removed once it has been published on the social media platform.",,
"Reporting could be more friendly, A/B testing is a little problematic and no heatmaps",,
"Social: Some social media posts fail without warning, causing inability to use for agency purposes.",,
"I don't like that I can only upload one photo per social media post, and I don't like how difficult it is to customize things.",wishes:Actionable:features,
I am also surprised at the lack of functionality when reporting like viewing and editing form submissions.,,
It takes a long time to master.,,
This would be one of the only current drawbacks with hubspot.,,
"After moving over to the same tool we use for our main website, the functionality offered seemed limited in terms of design even though it integrated into the HubSpot lead activities.",,
It would be nice to have a builder more like Unbounce.,,
at over £2k.,,
What I find troublesome with HubSpot is the lack of accessibility once you've reached a certain number of users.,,
"While it's very user friendly,  ",,
"Two primary points of failure:
",,
just recommended them yesterday.,,
It's annoying to have to use the reports in order to export a list of contact with some deal properties.,,
There are certain applications when this would be useful.,,
"That's for my personal, small company. 
",,
Has good quality.,,
"The coding can be limited, and sometimes e-mail marketing can be cumbersome if you're formatting in HTML.",,
I would rather them make it than me having to create it in photoshop first.,,
Some of the templates can be hard to manipulate without experts.,,
I have often found myself wanting to do what I thought were basic tasks that are simply not currently present in the software.,,
"But, its team always respond to our feedback and they are always willing to help when we experience some issue.",,
imports can be difficult if you do not have access to excel.,,
I experienced some technical issues with the software in the past but not anymore.,,
"Additionally, Hubspot lets politics and off-topic messaging creep into the way they conduct business.",,
"It would be more helpful for our company if all of the sales people could see the specific HubSpot Intelligence, not just the brief overview.",,
HubSpot likes to make these types of small changes without warning and without a legacy option to continue as things were.,,
"I wish there are some additional features in Forms that are currently missing. 
",,
There have been a lot of system outages lately which makes sending emails and pulling data less reilable.,,
"So I'd suggest them to have an ability to customize simple features ourselves e.g. when we send outbound outreach sequence, later we are not able to sort recipients by a number of opens or views.",,
"There's good information on individual emails right now, but not comparing them in batches or against each other, and that can be hindering at times.",,
"If I am missing a delete section, then someone please let me know!",Actionable:UX,
"There is a lot to learn as a new user, and 9 months in we find ourselves having to clean up some of the areas which had been incorrectly implemented during those first exploratory months.",,
I think everything is pretty easy to navigate once you figure it out.,,
Some of the CRM integrations can add a significant cost to the monthly price as well.,,
There are so many add-on products.,,
"The all rounder nature of Hubspot can mean that 80:20 they lack some of the more intricate features that point solutions have in sales, Automation, CRM, CMS or Support.",integrations,
Initually templates and pages can be confusing and some things I've wanted to do required code writing.,,
"I also didn't care much for our certified HubSpot marketing agency, they struggled to add value to the project and ended up adding way too much overhead to our budget.",,
that an oppty has been in a given stage.,,
Perhaps an onboarding system will help phase out confusion.,,
"When working with client's, it's important to set the expectation that things like reporting, metrics, personalization tokens, etc., can only be successfully used if the data is available.",,
But as a complementary application it can have better features.,,
The pricing is a bit odd.,,
"Their pricing plans are affordable for the most part, but in order to get really good reporting from the system, you need to be on a higher plan.",price,
"As a social media manager, the only thing I wish HubSpot offered was a social connection to Pinterest and Instagram.",wishes:Actionable:features,
"The biggest downside to HubSpot is the reliance on templates that allow no customization — namely, templated landing pages.",,
"For $200 per month, the Basic package allows you to grow and refine your business as you build momentum with inbound marketing.",,
And the voice that is being recorded is being saved in different context .so,,
"As someone who wears multiple hats, it's hard to monitor multiple sources of outreach when they have different triggers.",,
This would be hugely beneficial for high-level reporting for management functions.,,
- Need ideas for content creation?,,
It's great that the platform is developing all the time,,
"The only improvement I would like to see implemeneted is through social outreach, being able to tag people/companies easier would be great.",features:wishes:Actionable,
"It is also very difficult to create loops so instead of just verifying that you are intentionally creating a loop, you have to get pretty creative and create multiple workflows to achieve a loop.",,
There's nothing that we dislike about Hubspot!,,
"HubSpot promised us an easy-to-use platform for marketing and customer service, which could not be farther from the truth.",,
I think the design tools could be strengthened.,,
"Since Hubspot started as a contacts-based system, reporting from an account-based view can be incredibly difficult.",,
"HubSpot is expensive, especially for small businesses.",,
You can't really A/B test emails that are in a workflow or automation.,,
It would help me a lot if HubSpot made it possible to use personalisation tokens in email IF statements.,,
The learning curve is high.,UX:support,
Due to the ability to customize so much withing HubSpot we have a third party company that services our account to ensure everything is staying connected and to work out any of our technical issues.,,
Hubspot doesn't recognize duplicates and doesn't allow you to copy a deal and edit some information.,,
Need to know some code if customizing telplates,,
simplifying the custom code section might help that.,UX:Actionable,
I think HubSpot's UX could be a bit more welcoming.,,
The email designer is a bit more limited than some others I have used.,,
Metrics sometimes don´t match in social media or Google Analytics.,,
I truly think this platform is the best tool an inbound marketer can have in his arsenal.,,
"I think it might be a bit expensive, however if you are a big corporation, the cost is not insane and actually brings back a huge return on investment.",,
It really is only good for tracking the sales process rather than the renewal process.,,
Not very robust with the CRM and CMS portion of the product.,features:integrations,
I would rather send a plain text email ONLY for internal workflows.,,
"At times new tools can feel like they need more depth to be useful; however, that depth usually comes quickly.",,
There are parts that could be more detailed and more organized.,,
The add ons can get really expensive unless you can work with a salesperson to get a deal.,,
"Additionally, the reporting is built to accommodate contacts reports, but is not nearly as robust for reporting at the company level.",,
"However, the online chat has been able to help me with any questions I may have.",,
"A lot of times Hubspot didn't sent the e-mail, and I don't know why!",bugs,
Frequent interface upgrades can sometime make it difficult to track down my favorite tools.,,
"I try to leave it alone as much as possible.
",,
I wish workflows were a bit easier to edit for contacts currently enrolled.,,
"the development and refinement of websites would be easier if there were hotkeys/shortcuts integrated with the CMS platform, and it would save my designers and me a lot of working time.",,
"It's crazy expensive for a small startup like ours, and it's tough for us to afford all of the features we'd like to be using.",,
"Some of the attribution features are a bit basic, so I am working with some outside developers to help implement tracking pixels for facebook and google that are action-based ie: adds to cart, abandoned cart, etc.",,
Dynamic/smart content functionality is limited to use within only Rich Text fields.,,
"It was frustrating that our CRM and Marketing Automation tools didn't quite communicate as well as they wanted to and the longer our program went, the more our inside team struggled to get the information they needed to follow up on the inbound leads.",,
"However, there is always the option to revert to the old look for a while, but in those few seconds before you realize there is a change, you're lost.",,
Getting everyone trained on Hubspot has been difficult - the level of customization has created a confusing jumble for anyone who is seeing it for the first time.,,
"If you are not familiar with HTML or CSS code it takes a little time to learn your own customizations, but the support team is always quick to jump in when needed.",,
"Other than that, HubSpot is everything I want it to be.",,
It has been a nightmare since day one.,,
It is always being updated and improved.,,
"So if you make a mistake you have to traul through a lot of data. 
",,
Right now they do not support Twitter or YouTube ads.,,
And email deliverability is a HUGE problem.,,
so you have to sort/scroll down the page often to find your notes mixed in with your email messages.,,
"When I create a form and then go into Landing Pages and choose the form in the drop-down option, the information I chose in forms doesn't translate over to the Landing Page.",,
"Unfortunately, it's not yet possible to see or choose all the metrics that tools like Google AdWords or Facebook Ads are able.",,
The only thing is that it's not very intuitive at first glance.,UX,
"Also, this doesn't integrate as well as Sales Force with other applications but hopefully down the road new functionality will be rolled out.",,
"The calendar view is the best way to vision my mostly social, but it's not always the most user friendly.",,
Practical exercises required a percentage of success so they can count towards the accomplishment of them.,,
There are a few things that could use improvement.,,
They are still beta testing some things so some things don’t work how I’d always like.,,
I also wish there was some way to track link clicks from Instagram Stories in the Hubspot Reports.,,
"As a millennial, digital tools come easy to me.",,
"The support is good, but you have to spend time to get the full benefits out of the system.",,
"I live in the Content part of the portal, and I wish it had a more intuitive interface for content creation and entry, akin to Grammarly or HemingwayApp.",,
"Sometimes I also find that you have to figure processes out, and that there's no one simple and straightforward way to do something.",UX:support,
Hubspot's Reporting tool seems more rudimentary than we would have liked.,,
I also learned that Hubspot prefers their relationship with the marketing firms that push their products over their direct clients.,,
I've made a few educated guesses which haven't worked out.,,
You need to learn to code in Hubspot or find someone who does otherwise you won't build good sites.,,
Year 1 is generally a great price.,price,
I can't say bad about it.,,
I wish I had more control of customizing the data charts and reports.,,
"We use the Hubspot API to create deals, update contacts, and move deals through a pipeline.",UX:integrations,
The Content Manager needs more access and authorities.,,
It can be tough to build-out custom features without having an in-house programmer.,,
"We are able to manage multiple social media accounts with minimal effort, something that took a lot of time before to post is now super easy to do.",,
"Quick controls are nested in drop downs, modules don't scope well, and modular ability is only one level deep.",,
One thing that can sometimes be a source of frustration is the rapid pace of change at Hubspot.,,
"Some places, you can only have one top level folder, other areas you can have folders within folders to organize your assets.",,
"Not impossible, but just a bit harder.",,
I wish the free/trial version didn't have so many limitations.,,
Pricing model is not very healthy for young companies that aim to grow quickly.,price,
Working on Hubspot wasn’t always smooth sailing.,,
The constant change in the design.,,
they charge you per every additional 1k (after initial 20k,,
But that is a champagne problem!,,
"In addition, I can see when emails, social media posts, landing pages and blogs have been published and scheduled.",Actionable:features:wishes,
Reports could be a little more robust.,,
"Most content is B2C, and the B2B resources are mostly software-related.",,
You need to pick a very simple template for landing pages when doing the skinning process because you can not customize easily and changes need to be made in the template.,,
"You can add CSS and Javascripts to your pages so the possibilities to customize are quite endless. 
",,
The social media tool is pretty basic considering how complex all of the other tools are.,,
The one thing I dislike about Hubspot is that limits the size of images that can be posted on Instagram.,,
It's sometimes hard to keep track of all these changes and know when something new has been released until you log in one day and things have changed.,,
"Creating material, building reports, getting information to the sales team, would have been a better way for us to start.",,
The certifications are also a little odd and time consuming to obtain.,,
"Also, we would really benefit from a priority tool for both tasks and projects.",,
There are a lot of different menus and screens - it takes a lot to remember what exact screen to go to depending on what I want!,,
It has been something we have been trying to work through for a year now.,,
It also doesn't recognize sales emails which is one of our big problems: people getting both a marketing and a sales email on the same day.,,
"For example, before the ""email frequency cap"" was implemented, we had to set up a special workflow and run each of our emails through that to ensure our clients didn't receive too many of our emails.",,
When editing a set of posts scheduled for social media I have to edit them individually even though they have the same content.,,
The only time I lost my temper with HubSpot was after switching on live chat - the system overloaded me with messages and alerts...,,
I have more design options with tools more specific to the task.,,
"This makes me wonder how many other engaged, active users of ours have been kicked off our newsletters' email lists, and how this is affecting our overall open rates.",Actionable:features:bugs,
"For our company that has loaded many old pages too, its difficult to find certain things.",,
The reporting could be a lot better.,,
"What are these benefits of using HubSpot?
",,
"Limitations with workflows and reports, but both are being worked on :)",,
It's not a good tool to cheaply set up weighted marketing attribution on your touches.,,
"I will say that this software is a bit on the pricey side, especially when your business starts growing and you need to add additional capabilities to the software.",,
"One thing I would love to see HubSpot do is create a landing page builder that doesn't have to be code, but that can be drag and drop like the email builder.",,
The challenge comes when you want to do more with the templates they give  you.,,
Reporting is poor and the ability to link deals and contacts need improvement.,,
"Lastly, we run into issues with people not receiving our emails, I wish there was a more guaranteed or easier way to make sure they do because I love that HubSpot tells us whether the person opened it but if the emails don't go through because of their security then we sometimes have to send it through outlook with is more guaranteed.",,
"Still really simple and user friendly, but coming from a marketing background I am used to have more options regarding email design and social media management tool.",,
"If your company is relatively small and you do not have a full-time person dedicated to working the inbound marketing strategy, or work together with an inbound marketing agency, Hubspot prove to be too much for you.",,
"If you're smart and enjoy solving problems, you can typically find a workaround while features are being developed.

"In addition, we use a few automated workflows to send emails to contacts that meet qualifying criteria.",,
Not sure why because it worked wonderfully and was very useful.,,
Not as powerful as Marketo but also not as difficult to learn as Marketo.,,
and I have lost work.,,
"While the analytics are intuitive, they are sometimes hard to find.",,
Changes in system sometimes lead to navigational challenges.,,
The analytics dashboard can be a bit confusing.,,
"Quick similar to Apple when they announce a new app for their watch that calculates the energy you've burned while doing yoga, but the users wanted a more durable charger for their iPhone.",,
"Shortcuts for example.

"The analytics it collects is great but you're going to have to pick one or the other when it comes to Google Analytics, since they both collect differently.",,
- this means I don't use it.,,
Some of the reporting could be easier.,wishes:UX:Actionable:features,
I would love to see HubSpot manage more complex data.,,
I really dislike the reporting and the ability to fine tune parameters within HubSpot.,,
"The email templates feature under ""conversations"" is very weak.",Actionable:features:wishes,
"The weakest part of HubSpot for me is their source tracking if the default is ""Offline Sources"" and in my opinion, they could be much more precise but don't seem to care to outside of the obvious source tags like Organic, PPC, Referal etc.",,
This was a bit frustrating,,
"With automation, a big drawback is a limitation in personalization fallbacks.",,
The amount of training that is needed to use - it took most everyone on my team a good bit of time to understand the process and how the platform works.,,
"I dislike how everything has to be viewed in a queue and not in a calendar view, it would a lot better if that was possible.",,
I dislike the cost to scale up a HubSpot account with new features.,,
"It's still easy, just not as easy as everything else with HubSpot.",,
"Nothing, I highflying recommend this product and have advocated for it at other companies.",,
"It stops working sometimes, the colors are too serious, it's hard to look for clients with spanish names because some characters are too important like the accent.",bugs:UX:Actionable,
"The social aspect of HubSpot has downsides some being

If you don't need to report out of a separate tool though this might not be an issue for you.,,
Hubspot is also pretty complicated when it comes to managing lists and contacts.,,
so I know it's only a matter of time.,,
Must log in to Social platform at the same time and cannot use anything else other than an emoji 'Like.',,
"I've heard great things about Marketo, but I've never used it personally.",,
"The reporting could be improved, other than that can't think of any con.",,
"The search function in many areas (images, file manager, emails) doesn't work very well.",,
It'd also be nice to have the ability to tag a location with Instagram.,,
"For example, social media is a bit hidden.",,
and I had to license Sales Pro for each ID as it could not manage more than 1 per Sales Pro login.,,
I also think creating reports is super confusing and should be more user friendly.,,
I wish that the word processor element of email design was more fluid.,,
"Especially given that a certain amount of contacts generated are missing from this view, likely due to it's reliance on auto-tracking.",,
Community management is awful!,,
"The email builder, for example, can be very buggy and frustrating to work with some time.",,
It's difficult to give people points in real-time (for example if someone opens x amounts of emails within a certain period of time).,,
But I have found some issues with social posts deploying.,,
"Landing page, sales tools, chat function all worse than what you can find anywhere",,
"If this was streamlined, it would be simpler to browse through.",,
Not a single thing I can think of right now.,,
How often the site is under construction and things don't save appropriately,,
"There have been some outages this year that have caused some issues, but other than that, it runs well.",,

The templates will not load a lot of the time when using my Gmail.,Actionable:bugs,
In my company the HubSpot reporting tools are a bit confusing for us.,,
Our dev team has a hard time working with the tool because they find it restrictive and more complex then it needs to be.,,
The HubSpot platform offers a ton of features so there's definitely a learning curve if you've never used a marketing automation platform before.,,
The more automation you seek out of the software the more you will pay.,price:features,
"Although it's nice to see HubSpot is putting effort into keeping their software as up to date as possible for users, the template gets changed quite often and it can delay usage because the roll out tends to slow work down slightly.",,
The reporting tool have to be paid in extra while I think that this is the core feature that should be included in Professional plan.,,
Answers are provided quickly.,,
Little hard to navigate the website gets confusing options could be simplified.,,
"Huge learning curve, very very difficult tests for ""certification"" that did not seem necessary at all.",UX:support,
The UI is clunky and off mark.,,
"Additionally, much of the contact specific engagement data (specific pages viewed, list of emails opened, etc.) isn't exportable, nor available through the API.",,
"An alternate view, perhaps closer to how a tower of code logic is displayed, would be a great option.",,
"In addition, their CMS just didn't work for us--",,
"The expense, while I like all the tools together the expense to have these together is not cheap.",,
It would be amazing if they had the ability to autopost videos or tag individuals in pictures.,features:Actionable:wishes,
It can take a lot of time to use all the functionality on offer as it is vast.,,
The social publisher could be better but it hasn't stopped us from achieving our aims.,,
"It's not perfect, but I've noticed HubSpot has really ramped up their Customer feedback programs as I am now speaking with their Product managers on a regular basis.",,
For a small business like our Hubspot can be a bit intimidating at first.,,
I'm used to Pardot,,
That seems very silly that a platform with such vastness would not allow you to post a video which is something marketers value to get their message seen and heard.,,
It messes up data and reports.,,
The cost is quite high for the full suite of features.,price,
I find discrepancies in reports from Google Analytics and Hubspot.,,
I would recommend asking a CSS developer for help.,,
"For instance, I have a field called Connected By for contacts where I list how I met the person, but I can't see that field for companies.  ",,
The template designs could be a little more flexible so the changing them around does not become very complex.,,
"Once you run out of free options, it is actually quite pricey to maintain the same features.",,
There are some features that seem intuitive that HubSpot doesn't have.,,
Basic reporting is non-existent in HubSpot.,,
I have to explain my clients every time the design change.,,
"Also, if you use URL to enter a new company you don't always get what you entered.",,

"On the flip side, sometimes if I open my ""sent"" email that is tracked, Hubspot tells me ""someone opened this email.""",bugs:features:Actionable,
There have a been a few times I had to get a mass email out quickly but had to quickly re-learn how to use the tool.,,
I like that I can easily customize pre-made templates.,,
Honestly there is not anything that I dislike.,,
It would be nice if there were videos fro each tab like creating a webpage or something.,,
This program is such a headache.,,
"With that, their reporting tools are excellent and give us a great overview of how our marketing efforts are performing.",,
May be a wizard type or a timeline navigational structure can showcase status of each contact and its journey from lead to customer.,,
"It's on the expensive side, though to be fair, when compared to other marketing automation platforms, it is priced quite reasonably.",price,
"Jack of all trades, master of none. 
",,
Social features are not as robust as I would like and can be difficult to do comprehensive reporting on.,,
It can be hard to properly tie all the tools together.,,
"It is pretty standard in terms of templates so if you don't have design experience or team, it is hard to have a lot of creative liberties in the process.",,
Sometimes they prioritize other training updates over others.,,
There may be a setting to change this - but I have yet to find it!,,
"You also really do need to have a grasp on at least basic coding -- and even then, hubspot template building can be frustrating.",,
This reason would prevent some companies from implementing it.,,
- User-friendly with the possibility of managing almost every single inbound action,,
Waiting for some better email editor-,,
The email and website feature can be very slow at times.,,
"It used to be super easy to make changes in Hubspot, but now I have to put the code into dreamweaver to make changes. 
",,
At times it can be a bit glitchy but HubSpot is constantly improving and coming out with new ways to make their tools better.,,
Hubspot still has work to do in spanish and portuguese speaking markets.,,
Sometimes information is a little hard to find.,,
The design side of emails is also difficult for our designer to work with.,,
"Quizá, por esto mismo, la parte más compleja es la de gestión de contactos, creación de listas etc, así como la de emailing, pues hace uso de código avanzado cuando buscas desarrollar funciones fuera de  las plantillas.",,
"Without advanced coding knowledge, it's sometimes difficult to modify or update email and landing page templates to meet your specific needs on a  given project.",,
"There isn't a lot of tech/API support past the documentation, so it's been a rough time working at making it work for our company's needs.",,
The website editing tool is very confusing and difficult to work with.,,
"For example, when creating social posts, you can tag users on Twitter but can't do this for Facebook posts.",features:Actionable:wishes,
"Also, you have to pay for a lot of features if you want to upgrade.",,
That is a big draw-back.,,
"You mean to tell me that this software can't babysit my children, wash my car, or mow my lawn???",,
"I do think, as a nonprofit, that being able to integrate a fully featured donation database would be useful as well.",,
"For it to be useful, all of our salespeople have to know exactly how to use it and then ACTUALLY USE IT.",,
"For example, I can't post Facebook or Instagram stories, videos to Instagram, GIFs to Facebook, videos larger than a certain size, or videos to YouTube.",,
so I can post about it on social media.,,
"This would be useful, especially for Instagram, since that particular site doesn't have clickable links.",,
"First, if you are a B2B company, this might not be the software for you.",,
We get around some of that with their Lists function.,,
I think its not integrated with some of the websites and functioning as per user friendly interface for the micro websites integration in the Hub spot.,,
I think the marketing software is sometimes a little bit limited.,,
"They have a set of best practices for marketing and sales processes, and their platform will sometimes not allow you to easily deviate from their pre-designed setup.",,
"it`s updated in contacting manner that allows our company to create a list of different groups,builds our database so that our sales team can do a more efficient job and focus on strategies specific to each work group.
",,
I wish the social tools had more insight into what times and days perform the best for our audience.,,
They rely heavily on their consultant network which can be costly to the companies using them.,,
Also the application should be more flexible.,,
"As a business owner, I feel it's unethical to have that kind of total control over my clients' marketing programs.",,
Analytics tools are also quite comprehensive.,,
Although I wished the support team knew more HTML and CSS,,
Hubspot is not flexible.,,
Sometimes is gets nitpicky with the layout I am trying to achieve.,,
I also think the reports dashboard is a bit confusing and could be easier to use.,,
but it is very hard to understand.,,
that we can no upload a bunch of pictures to the slide module you need to do it one by one,,
"Thankfully, HubSpot does work fast to remedy these kinds of problems, so it hasn't been anything particularly disastrous.",,
No problems have ever been had or run into.,,
I find the price to be a little bit high compared to similar softwares!,,
Pricing not really designed for startups.,,
It helps to start small and do some training before taking the deep dive.,,
"I'm a big fan, so there's not much about HubSpot I dislike.",,
It would help for studying and clarifying definitions.,support:UX,
"If you like sales people that lie, unhelpful account managers and vague and evasive customer support reps, then I can whole-heartedly recommend HubSpot.

Hubspot is constantly updating a moving a things around.,,
"Some modules remain locked until you have received the practicum back, causing delays in getting certified.

"While analyzing our social media and blog data, I wasn't always sure what some terms meant, so it would be helpful to have a pop-up cheat sheet of sorts that users can refer to easily and quickly.",,
I'm not a huge fan of how Contacts are set up.,,
You will need to have a developer on staff or hire a freelancer to style the forms to match your site or landing page.,,
but I don't like it :(,,
"Additionally, the live chat service has thus far proven unusable for our company.",,
"Their Keyword tool is only good for very basic keyword research, and they don't have a robust feature set for any MOFU/ MT attribution  ",,
There was also not enough guidance in the email automation processes.,,
"The social media app could use some help as well as the bulk uploading feature is very... well, bulky.",,
Nothing to really dislike.,,
"Most of the best features are paid, so it can be quite challenging for small companies to make full use of HubSpot.",,
The sometimes weird kinks in the system - i.e. it was showing the wrong pictures for days and no one could tell me why.,,
I spend so much time creating the same modules over and over again.,,
Also there seems to be a lot of turnover within the technical support team that supports us.,,
"Many of the features are not available on their free version, but the upgrades are definitely worth it if you are going to use all of the capabilities.",,
The vast majority of incoming contacts we get is via webforms and the mechanism HubSpot uses to manage incoming forms is atrocious.,,
"Since HubSpot CRM is still relatively new compared to other major CRM and social media management tools players, there are some feature limitations you may run into if you’re looking to satisfy more complex automated marketing processes.",,
I would like more information on the back end regarding who/what/when changed data in the CRM.,,
I have a workaround for this when I add my own lists.,,

"That said, they have already announced enhancements which will bring more flexibility.",,
"HubSpot has recently changed their reports to ""simplify"" them, which seems at first like a good thing, however, with these simpler reports we've lost access to a lot of data points we used to rely on.",,
Also anytime we have to go into the design editor to fix issues with website templates we have a difficult time getting the pages to adjust in the way we desire it to.,,
"I signed up to test it out, entered a bunch of leads, and set up my contact form to receive leads and started testing it out.",,
Some of the tools are disjointed and lack interfaces that guide the process.,,
My least favorite feature would relate to some of the email marketing functionality.,features,

"Sometimes it disconnects randomly from Gmail, and the email scheduling also does not have a way to unschedule automatically if the client replies.",,
"Also, I think it would be much easier if any reminders or notifications are desktop enabled.",,
I'm a slow learner sometimes when it comes to new software!,,
It's hard to change the design on the front.,,
We're still going through the on-boarding process but so far the experience has been great.,,
"Overall, I think more companies should use it.",,
The software depends on a good internet connection.,,
I'm always wanting to go a bit deeper!,,
This survey won't submit unless you have a certain amount of words in it - which is not good.,,
This requires you to shut the site down and open it again for it to work correctly again.,,
Just a few small features I would like but nothing that hinders me from doing my job.,,
It really just depends on what you're doing.,,
"Right now we have all of our landing pages designed with a ""designer manager"" that is going to be replaced by a new one, and templates may not be compatible!!",,
"As of now, nothing really comes to mind.",,
by more than the allowed ways HubSpot provides.,,
The recent phase out of embedded SEO analytics has been a pain.,updates:UX:integrations,
I dislike the price of Hubspot.,,
"I definitely liked the old layout better, and am still adjusting to the update.",,
There is nothing I necessarily dislike about Hubspot but there are limitations Hubspot has that other software is better suited for.,,
"Also, wish Hubspot made it easier to end automatic emails  and reminder after someone signed up for an event.",,
"This isn't often though, but it is a concern.",,
"Don't make me schedule each tweet/post, just ask me how many times I want it to go out, with what frequency, and schedule them for me.",,
I would love to be able to export these types of properties.,,
but I can never find it in the search.,,
Pricing based on contacts on the marketing side yet priced per user on the sales and service sides.,,
"That once I set a ""due date"" on a project, I get constant reminders that I have missed a deadline.",,
"Also, recently our chat bot has been acting up and giving our incoming visitors an error message :/",,
"Pretty expensive, some basic features are not available in the enterprise edition (A/B) testing for example.",,
"Social, ads and email beed to have more features with more variety options and better reporting.",Actionable:features:wishes,
It just provides you with a general idea of which platform engaged new contacts.,,
so you still have to reach another website.,,
"Unfortunately, the functionality just doesn't work for us anymore.",,
"Some limitations in support forms like, no more than 1 dependency.",,
I also use HubSpot to create landing pages and host content and the templates for those types of pages are a bit clunky/dated and not super customizable.,,
It's very difficult to see the full path to conversion by exporting a large list of leads.,,
but I am not sure whether i have fully understood this yet.,,
They do show a lot but not all of the statistics are shown and it makes it harder for reports to be made for upper management to see all of the success numbers.,,
I wish there were more actionable triggers in the workflow creation.,,
That I can't post the same content twice in the same day on twitter...,,
Its such a substantial platform that stuff sometimes falls through the cracks during updates,,
It would be nice to have one shared instance but the ability to separate reporting.,,
Really helps a lot and very fast.,,

"As with any system, what you put in is what you get out.",,
It's hard for me to describe what I dislike about a software which is helping me to get my job done and generate great marketing KPIs.,,
but it's all there,,
"I can eventually find what I need to edit, but it isn't as intuitive as I would like being a novice website editor.",,
A few small bugs that I hope get worked out.,,
"There's not much to dislike at this point, I am still getting used to it.",,
Not necessarily an issue with the software more of a quality of life issue.,,
"For social, your links do not shorten in preview mode.",,
Hubspot does not provide great analytics for social media.,,
"They said ""trust us"" and we did.  ",,
This would pertain to being an agency partner -- I have many smaller budget clients that I would not be able to use this for since they would be required to set up their own account with Hubspot for $200/month.,,
Aside from that I wish they offered more advanced training for developers building on their CMS but in general training for the product as a whole is really solid.,,
I do wish the developer side of Hubspot was more flexible.,,
And some weren't applicable becaus of my situation -- I was taking it for a company that had already established things like their buyer persona and a twitter account,,
One of my accounts has disconnected and it won't let me re-connect.,,
"Since this marketing tool is constantly evolving and continues to expand its services, there may be functions that are used frequently and are no longer there.",,
"The HubSpot academy is so helpful that when you're stuck or in face of a problem, you'll easily find resources to help you!",,
"We use this as a way to keep track of all our documents - I think we use it as an implementations tool only so we can be in the loop with our sales team, so it's not useful for us on a day to day.",,
You can't tap into CRM functions and export all data you need,,
"Also the UI is not intuitive at all, making training new employees more work than ideal.",,
"Although it's not necessarily a problem with Hubspot, certain social media upload capabilities are missing such as carousel images on Instagram in the social media marketing area.

"I don't think you can really use it to it full potential unless you read through all their user blogs, Google a few things and have your manager train you a bit on it if you are a first time Hubspot user.",,
There needs to be a marketing strategist on hand to help map out the plan.,,
"Attribution is quite elementary, and there are a few attribution factors I would like control over.",,
What might seem like simple changes to styles sometimes require real-world coding experience to change.,,
I would like more consistency across the platform for customization.,,
It would be helpful in determining the best strategy for moving forward.,,
They are currently in beta for live chat,,
I don't know what is bad on this platform.,,
I think that they are a high-value relationship!,,
"Such as, looking for the page where I can create redirects always takes me a few minutes to figure out.",,
There is a lot to HubSpot.,,
"Although, it's quite sufficient for me, as a marketer most times.",,
"They keep coming out with new things and changes which can make it hard to keep up with HubSpot, This might not always be a bad thing",,
Hubspot is an awesome tool and they are continuously updating the product.,,
The only reason I say nearly all is because our website is hosted on WordPress -,,
We use Google Analytics for serious analysis of site traffic.,,
It would be nice if the sales version allowed you to send on behalf of another user.,,
so I have to go back and edit on the separate social media channels individually.,,
To really get going with automation you have to upgrade and the cost ramps up very quickly.,,
"The opening for order and lead conduction is incomplete, complex and difficult to perceive.",,
"But having said that, the Community comments allow these requests to be flagged to HubSpot and it's team are very vocal in these conversations to feedback to developers.",,
"For example, I created a new Topic with subtopics, and when assigning a blog post on the calendar, it took over a day for the new Topic to show in the Topic drop down field on the calendar.",,
The FREE plan just about dabbles into the touching the basis for enjoying your Hubspot account.,,
Sometimes the contacts  are repeated twice as a duplicate.,Actionable:bugs,
no 'autoschedule' feature is kind of a drag.,,
"There are some logic features not available when it comes to integrating workflows, sequences and emailing newsletters",,
We spend way too many wasted hours in meetings because they saw a 3% drop in calls on Fridays (translation=we had about 10 less calls made!!).,,
But we got the hang after a while and just use those features that apply to us.,,
Sometimes someone has clearly opened their email that I'm tracking - because they've responded to me - but I don't get a Hubspot notification.,features:bugs:Actionable,
I do not like how it is hard to import and export contacts.,,
"If I could say only 1 thing I didn't like, sometimes there be a few instances where I felt options should be more customizable (especially email).",,

UI & UX Design needs urgent improvement.,,

Managing social in Hubspot is not great.,,

"They're always innovating and the tools are always changing, usually for the better.  ",,
"Their onboarding process wasn't informative, I was told to watch hours upon hours of video training",,
"The ads tool is also not ideal mainly because of how it tracks conversions based on the last touch, instead of the original source.",,
"I've learned to work around it as has my team, but it's not possible to have two people editing an email or landing page at the same time because you can't save out changes if another person is in the tool.",bugs:features:wishes:Actionable,
We have two different blogs hosted on one website which makes it hard to differentiate the emails and who they should go to.,,
"I've been kicked off the newsletter email list for the newsletter that I specifically create/send every week, even though I'm an active, engaged user.",,
We also want to move to more of an ABM approach and need help using HubSpot to manage our accounts.,,
"But I have enjoyed learning, and the resources are great.",,
The if/then decision criteria could be split into 5-10 way options rather than just 2 (yes/ no).,,
"My exposure to the software has only been limited to the work I was doing involving landing pages, website pages and working on script.",,
And the mobile feature of scanning is not ideal for all business cards.,,
Hubspot's pricing structure is not great.,price,
The email marketing is limited in terms of design.,,
Being able to do this would allow me to cancel our Unbounce subscription and I could funnel more funds into buying additional Hubspot add-ons if I could add trackable forms on Unbounce.,,
We use premium support and I highly recommend this if you have the budget: it's fantastic.,,
This prevents one from using HubSpot as the sole tool.,,
"If I really had to pick one, I wish that it was easier to make new",,
"The trial version has many limitations so in order to know what the potential of this tool is, it is necessary to purchase a paid version.",,
I do not like the email building software at all.,,
I find that it's not always easy to find what I am looking for on HubSpot and often have to cross-reference with Google Analytics when I'm studying website traffic.,,
but it'd still be convenient to pull in keyword and topic data.,,
and it's not very good when I'm working with client contacts and trying to develop business use case emails.,,
"Workflows is another great feature, that takes your marketing efforts to next level.",,
Sometimes it was unclear from the description what the module did.,,
"Oh wait, maybe the cost.",,
"I dont like the price of the product, i thin",,
"Nothing to dislike here, apart from the fact that the tool does take some time to get hands-on to.",,
Sometimes I wait a week for a response.,,
"Integration with our website, which is on wordpress was a bit tricky, but it worked eventually.",,
"For example, the toolbar when typing does not hover over your words, so you need to scroll all the way down to change font, at URL, etc.",,
"Carrot-and-stick, like.",,
"Some correspondence doesn't always automatically file itself, but we haven't yet spotted why.  ",,
"Similarly, the workflow system can be improved by adding features like ""wait until something happens.""",,
"I don't like how there are often delays in updating or changing something, or the lag that sometimes exists in reporting.",Actionable:bugs:updates,
"It does take some time to set everything up to work the way you want it to, because of this we haven't made as much progress in implementing all of the capabilities as we had hoped by this time, particularly with the CRM.",,
"Trapping customers at a higher tier has been a struggle for our clients who aren't diligent on cleaning their list every month.

The forms never look how they should.,,
"However, if you use it to the best of its capabilities, it's worth the spend.",,
"They've made some improvements but it could be better.
",,
There are no basic functions in all areas.,UX,
"In addition, HubSpot is very limited in handling links from a web space to external sites.
",,
I have a lot of trouble loading contacts and the application script stops working frequently and is not helpful.,,
"It is also as technical as Salesforce, so lots of training and time required prior to using the tool.",,
It is easy to log activities and edit if needs be.,,
Just might be cost-prohibitive for certian busiensses.,,
I dislike the limitations that the free version has.,,
It's definitely not easy on the phone.,,
I haven't found anything I dislike about HubSpot yet.,,
It's also much better for posting than it is for monitoring when it comes to social media.,,
Analytics could be more detailed in reporting.,,
More times than not I have to double check that information I have added for a new contact and/or company is correct.,,
The hubspot marketing automation software is not for the shallow pocket bloggers or business owners as it has a minimum of 12 months contract plan,,
We need more robust measurement and reporting tools.,,
It's lacking the ability for sales uplines as well as cross-team use.,,
"For example, we recently wanted to quantify the forwarded rate of an email campaign, but that feature is not available through HubSpot.",,
The photo editor in the social media management program is a little hard to use.,,
We don't really get to use the social media reporting tools for that reason.,,
It does a lot but not as much as some of the other enterprise level solutions.,,
The lack of differentiation regarding their Workflows tools.,,
"In my opinion, it is difficult to set up reminders.",,
"It helps not only in management but also in evaluation and consequent improvement.
",,
"By clicking on a contact, you can see the emails and whether it was opened or not.",,
"While free versions are available, the costs are sometimes a bit confusing.",,
It is excellent to use the original networks before your management entry.,,
"We have integrated their chat function into our website, so far it is not as effective as claimed for starting customer conversations.",,
I also don't like that you can't upload multiple instagram pictures into one post.,,
"There's room for improvement in the number and sophistication of integrations with other software solutions, although this is true for most HubSpot competitors as well.",,
My only complaint would be that certain functions get updates without warning and then I feel very confused on how to use something that I normally use on a daily basis.,,
Silly mistake that I hope they will fix.,,
And more advanced features like custom data objects are not an available feature.,,
The issues that I encountered are related to the building of the templates.,,
The need to work both in design tools as well as website pages is a bit cumbersome.,,
There are times when I want to do cross reporting and the functionality is limited.,,
That once I save messages as drafts I can only edit one message at a time.,,
"When exporting a list or contacts the fields will be set to default every time and the fields which we generally use or last used won't be saved, and hence we have to handpick the fields from the lot which is time-consuming.",,
When I get stuck I just send a message to support and my problem is solved the same day.,,
"Some features, like PPC ads, are just dumbed down versions of tools you can get elsewhere for free.",,
Would be helpful to add the ability to create an org chart or some other type of matrix to see contact shifts and track relationships with customers.,,
Many applications and websites are easy to navigate but Hubspot seems to need some real teaching involved with my teammates.,,
Document storage tends to be complicated.,,
"There are more module designs, for instance, available on Wordpress.",,
"Over the past year, the HubSpot platform has been going through a major UI overhaul, which has resulted in an inconsistent and sometimes unpredictable UX.",,
"Ideally, we would like to be able to build our own dashboard with the contact, company, or deal fields we find most important to our workflow.",,
It seems to be costing more and I dont understand the prices.,price,
but I would prefer to have everything in one hub.,,
They change things... a lot.,,
Also deal workflows doesn't cross coperate with contact workflow.,,
I wish you didn’t need to raise a ticket for support and you could just ring a number.,,
"Also, the Ads add-on is really lacking, I think it is being developed more, but it is not worth the price at all.",,
We've noticed this issue maybe a handful of times.,,
Some file management could be better/easier to use and access.,,
There is a work around for this issue in the landing page editor but not in the social media scheduler.,,
I wish that there was more customizable templates for email that were less basic or that you could use common modules in custom templates,,
"I feel like a secret Marketing agent, and I get rewarded.",,
"The inability for workflow branches to reconnect for later actions after earlier if/then actions (for example) is a deficiency that requires ""daisy chaining"" series of workflows to accomplish desired multi-touch campaigns.",,
Every feature or function is adequate.,,
Its reporting could also be better/easier.,,
"As I am paying attention throughout the course, I did not listen to exact details and was not successful during those.",,
Is that even a real question?,,
My account manager changes pretty much every year since they are growing so much.,,
I would give design elements a 7/10.,,
- Quick automation - within a couple of weeks we had set up several simple automations on our lead gen and nurturing activities.,,
"Sometimes, when it comes to the HubSpot Academy, the deliverance of information is a bit dry and boring.",,
Deal tracking has limited view options and lacks the ability to track retainers or ongoing revenue.,,
Also would like more control over the lists.,,
"It's almost comical how out of step the builders are compared to others.
",,
"HubSpot is always open to hearing about ideas for enhancements though, and there's never been a situation I wasn't able to work around in the meantime.",,
We did need to hire a consultant to get the Salesforce - Hubspot integration.,,
Character limit on blog titles.,,
"We've had issues with emails getting sent to spam and high bounce rates and we didn't really get a solution other than it was a problem on the receiving end. 
",,
Sometimes Hubspot experiences some periods of down time.,,
Nest queries are not possible.,,
It seems like it's a step back.,,
More advanced reporting customization can be a bit tricky if you don't really know your way around HubSpot.,,
It can add little pieces of code.,,
"Every now and then I run into a feature I wish HubSpot had, but even then I generally can connect with someone to find a solution.",,
Sometimes it is hard to format text how I would like it to look.,,
"Also, sometimes you have to hit publish a couple of times before the page itself refreshes.",,
"If you have lower-budget clients and are considering their agency partner, its probably not a good fit.",,
The ONLY thing I dislike about Hubspot is the amount of stuff you get for free versus what you get if you pay for the service.,,
"Despite the fact that it is something little, I think it constrains my ability to contact.",,
I like it very much there is almost nothing I dislike,,
If you dont have light HTML/CSS knowledge you will be in serious trouble when trying to do a lot of customizations on a webpage or email template.,,
"Many marketers, including myself, would be very likely to create automations that have more complex outcomes.",,
so I've had to learn a little css and a few other things,UX,
The way that information is organized within the contact record can be confusing at times.,Actionable:support:UX,
No ability to create AMP landing page like Instapage,,
It is quite on the expensive side and the deals and quotes section feel very limited at times.,,
It has resulted in people editing templates when they are not supposed to.,,
"There have been a couple of instances when the whole platform seems to be down for a number of hours, making it very difficult to get any work done.",,
I would prefer a drag and drop option for each email created.,wishes:Actionable:features,
"Very cookie-cutter functionality; this is a software tool where you pay for what you good - a solid experience, but not top-of-the-line.",,
Sometimes Hubspot will behave slowly.,,
HubSpot has a number of limitations when it comes to functionality.,,
The reports method gives me comprehension of which posts are performing greater than others,,
I wish that it had more visual details of the module.,,
"Took us several months, if not longer, to learn all the tools.",,
"The social media calendar can be useful as it shows you what posts you have coming up for the month, but it's not as detailed of a view that other platforms provide, and doesn't show a snapshot of your feeds.",,
template/ Edit existing templates for non-developers.,,
We parted ways with the marketing company and I contacted Hubspot and requested a review.,,
HubSpot is a little pricey,,
It was not so easy to implement it the first time.,,
They'd really benefit from a drag and drop email editor and more function with importing and exporting HTML emails.,,
The graphics are pedestrian.,,
Hubspot's email builder tools leave a bit to be desired.,,
Hootsuite is a better social tool.,,
Sometimes when beginning to use Hubspot it can be hard to navigate around,,
This speeds up my administration and organization tasks.,,
"Sometimes, the process of inputting contacts and creating deals could be time-consuming.",,
I know that might sound lame.,,
"I really like this software, I use it a lot for my projects and other types of activities, I have nothing negative to comment on HubSpot.",,
"I do wish there was better reporting on email send rates, open rates, etc.",wishes:Actionable:features,
Requires a bit of a learning curve and its a bit expensive.,,
Hubspot has a terrible sync with Salesforce.,,
"You could tell their support was starting to lack and we kept having to find workarounds for everything we were doing, especially as it related to the SalesForce integration.",,
So far I haven't found anything that sticks out to me as a dislike on this platform.,,
"If I clean out my database of leads that one of the sales team dumps in, we still have to pay for the same number of contacts.",,
When the layout changed happened it made my life a little difficult.,,
It can be confusing at first (although the HubSpot software qualification helps you learn this).,,
so we downgraded to a simpler plan.,,
It works great for us but there are some very small problems that we have the the email section but nothing that actually hinders our business negatively.,,
"As well, simple suggestions like these seem to be ignored for a year or more even if multiple users bring it up.",,
"I wish there was more video capability in regards to the Instagram accounts through HubSpot, but they have already advanced their video uploading capability in Facebook and Twitter",features:Actionable:wishes,
There is also a learning curve associated with the software.,,
We have noticed some issues or missing capabilities when it comes to its integration with Salesforce.,integrations,
Their tech support group does not offer much on the customization side.,,
Perhaps I need more training. :-),,
"It would be nice to be able to see all the ways that things are linked together (lists, lead scoring, etc.)",wishes:features:UX:Actionable,
"In some cases, mainly regarding workflows, I do feel the need for an easier way to create multiple scenarios (branches for example) without having to repeat the conditions every time.",,
This makes it difficult to get accurate analytics on advertisements that are ran and also to follow leads that are gained from Facebook.,,
Social media management is a minus.,,
It is not a platform designed for anything above novice use.,,
"The required on-boarding had to be done within a certain time frame that was to Hubspot's convenience, not mine.",,
"Really, the plus for Hubspot is the univers building with the INbound.",,
I don't like how you cannot post a video to Linked in through social media automation.,features:wishes:Actionable,
"Also, the mobile responsible features are not well implemented knowing the fact that mobile users are the highest traffic to the website.  ",,
"Reporting is very straightforward, detailed and yet easy to read and understand.

You have to know a little bit about code to go in there an fix things.,UX,
I caught on quickly.,,
"I think that the landing page design module can be improved, compared to other landing page creators in the market.",,
Some in app support is needed (maybe tutorials) to make it easy to use for a non digital marketing individual.,,
"Sometimes I want to make a layout change, like spacing, that feels more difficult than necessary and even editing on the backend doesn't always work.",,
"Lacking some functionality around advanced lead scoring, multi-touch attribution and dynamic content.",,
"Like the Email is not custom much friendly for the beginners, The user is not having more control towards the analytics reporting, The smart forms are not applied when it is used in the non-Hubspot landing pages.",,
It would save a lot of time!,,
Also that the sales and marketing sides are kept separate in terms of email notifications to the sales team.,,
"My company uses Instagram quite a bit, so it would be helpful to have more access to the connection of social media through HubSpot.",,
"We don't have a graphic designer, so this is just a harder step for me personally.",,
"Being a global multi-national company, sometimes it's challenging to keep track on all the marketing automation processes that are happening through HubSpot.",,
but they are actually the tackiest photos I've ever seen.,,
They always seem to be increasing their price.,,
There are a few limitations when it comes to reporting on certain aspects.,,
Hubspot don't have a integration tool with Google Studio.,,
"The reporting side of things leaves something to be desired (even with the much-hyped new reporting add-on), but between GA, Salesforce, and our other reporting tools we are able to get what we need.",,
"I may need to upgrade my account soon to take full advantage of all the tools and features, but for not it is doing what I need it to do.",,
Nothing worth noting here.,,
"To bring their attention to new MQLs, marketing had to compile reports or a weekly basis to send to inside sales for follow-up.",,
There are bearly any marketing boundaries when it comes to Hubspot.,,
I'm still very new to HubSpot but the price to access all services.,,
It's extremely rigid in terms of restrictions on web development.,,
The social monitoring tool only tracks Twitter interactions; it would be nice if it worked with more social media channels.,,
Some of the email templates can be buggy.,,
and I think it was handled poorly.,,
The pricing is of course a bit prohibitive.,,
"There is nothing that I dislike, but it would be nice to maybe receive notification if there are updates to the course so that people already certified can update their skills.",,
If there was a way to streamline that process that would be great,,
I would love to be able to track a new hashtag every time we had an event.,wishes:Actionable:features,
The only thing I can truly critique is the email/newsletter feature.,,
"Maybe that some practical tasks, that were required in order to pass certification, were a stopper.",,
"It's not the easiest user interface to use if you are new, so it might take some time to get used to.",,
Still a bit limited.,,
"It’s essentially useless, and there are a number of CRMs that provide fantastic mobile features for iOS and Android devices.",,
The data reporting.,,
"The design manager has some tools that I just don't get it, I don't know why HubSpot created it's own language for one, but all in all",UX,
"Yes, you can use website pages only and custom modules, but these have too many limitations in terms of lay out.",,
"It seems like the charts in HubSpot intentionally have their color themes preset to make the charts look pretty, even if they don't make immediate sense.  ",,
It has a lot of black box that does not give developers freedom to integrate it with other tools.,,
"HubSpot has succesfully replaced a bunch of tools that we would otherwise require to manage all that we do.

I understand the different functions but it would be more optimal to have it all in one place.,UX:integrations,

"If they improved their landing pages, I would have no complaints with the software.",,
It would be nice in the dashboard to have options to see only your actions / at the same time as the companies actions (side by side).,,
"On the off chance that you ever do have an issue, their help group is constantly ready to unravel issues in an auspicious way.",,
Just when I get use to a feature it moves spots and changes the look.,,
For example with regards to making certain fields compulsory and if contacts are merged in another CRM that is integrated it would leave orphaned leads,,
I would like to be able to filter by different options,,
There is not much I dislike about HubSpot,,
"Sometimes I know I made a template about a certain topic, but unless I know the exact name it will not come up.",,
This causes more confusion and more learning without a huge benefit.,,
I do not dislike anything about Hubspot.,,
I'm finding it hard to think of anything I dislike about Hubspot.,,
I would like for there to be more in-depth reporting functionality.,,

"We also occasionally have some lag time with page loading, but it's infrequent.",,
"The social media reports

"If I can show a Youtube video directly to customers using HubSpot, I think it will make a much more compelling advertising platform.",,
"It was expensive, and we truly did not need it.",price,
ITs just really expensive overall.,price,
The lessons available too are pretty easy to understand.,,
There aren't many things I don't like Hubspot is easy to use and makes my job as a social media manager SO MUCH EASIER.,,
The CRM does not have the capacity to add numerous email delivers to a solitary contact record.,,
Sometimes I have a difficult time finding how to add things to my contact profile or changing the view of a dashboard.,,
"If the price was lower, I think it would fare much better with its competitors.",price,
"Currently, I have to upload videos in each platform to have a native video appear rather than a link.",,
but that's not often.,,
"Additionally, I dislike that when you edit/ build web pages, you have to edit it in a very small box on the left.",,
I do have another dislike as well about even after I have signed up I am constantly getting emails from their reps wanting me to signup.,,
"The Forms submission do not appear on the main inbox, and although this is a known issue to Hubspot, there has still been no fix provided.",UX:Actionable:bugs,
The previous perspective at the moment of programming an advertisement is enormously small.,,
no sea gmail o hotmail como si estuvieras registrando una empresa.,,
"Some basic features are still unavailable, expected to be addressed in time.",,
I've never had complaints with their service.,,
There are not any features I do not like in the small amount of experience I have had with the program.,,
"Because HubSpot caters to the users with minimum technical experience, the software can leave you wanting more in the customization department.",,
"Hubspot can be a bit overwhelming, however once you explore and can learn a little bit you are off and running so quickly!",,
"Its a great idea, but there are so many limitations that we do not really find it useful.",UX,
"It does make your images smaller, but the text seems to stay the larger, desktop size.",,
"Certain features don't offer as much functionality as I would like, however, Hubspot is great at listening to feedback and making updates based on customer requests.",,
I honestly want to finish the HubSpot Software certification and add more certifications to my profile,,
"Nevertheless, the free version does a great job!",,
You have to personalize their template.,,
"so I can continue sharing content that our client's followers are searching for.
",,
A lot of information logged on multiple records can be a disturbance.,,
"There is limitations on the social postings, specifically for Instagram where Hootsuite actually offers the ability to add multiple pictures in a slideshow variation but hoping HubSpot has this feature on the enhancement list.",,
"Not in-depth, and leaves out Twitter",,
75% of the time they solve the problem over chat.,,
I am pretty sure that Hubspot can be a powerful tool for a certain business or organization to be successful in their endeavors.,,
Pay a separate monthly fee.,,
"Also, workflows you can create are a very powerful tool we use when creating campaigns.",,
"Sometimes with the web page editor, the ways to customize your content can be limited.",,
Would be great if I could select a day of the week or time of day to send the emails out.,,
I wish we could create workflow automation templates that could be copied to other portals.,,
"I wish the chat box would answer my questions, not just direct me to the phone number.  ",support:UX:wishes,
"There is nothing to dislike, this is really the best program I have used for sales.",,
No challenges to date - am still evaluating reporting and integration capabilities.,,
"We still kept Unbounce, and our blog on wordpress for the sure customization aspect because we just didn't fell Hubspot was close to what Unbounce offered (landing page wise) we were even told when purchasing that many clients keep Mailchimp and Unbounce for these same reasons.  ",,
This can often take a while to be graded and returned to you.,support:UX,
Feels like you are just drowning in tabs and sub menus.,,
it's pretty consistent,,
I would also like to see LinkedIn integration for social media posts.,,
"Sure they could offer more features, but with a company like Hubspot I have no doubt that the capabilities will be more robust year over year.",,
Hubspot has a CRM as part of the software and do not provide ample support for third party CRM integration.,,
Especially the new Hubstars rewards program.,,
"By design, HubSpot is meant to be contact-oriented and not account-oriented.",,
"I had an issue with LinkedIn posts [images], but Hubspot' team is trying to solve it. 
",,
"Lately, there has been a few outages but everything seems to be reolved in a reasonable time frame.",,
I think HubSpot is doing a great job overall!,,
It can be difficult to work as a team on a project when only one person is allowed in the draft of an email or blog at a time.,,
I would love to see more reports and improved dashboard capabilities.,features:wishes:Actionable,
but maybe it would be better to be able to pay monthly and decide.,,
"For such a sophisticated software, the crappy editor is a real pain.",,
"Some of these extra fees are to be expected, but Hubspot will charge hundreds of extra dollars for features that other platforms include for no additional money.",,
We rely heavily on our in-house backend system.,,
the poor image quality when posting graphics has made us rethink our use of the platform.,,
but then again hopefully profits go up with it,,
I don't have much that I dislike.,,
"Other than that, no real dislikes!",,
It takes a while to get used to the system.,,
"The web editor seems a little bit bloated, and I think it could benefit for a minimalist design.",,
Design is finally easy due to specific templates setup by HubSpot.,,
"SEO features and design templates can use some work as well, but the main issue to many people I've recommended it to is price.",,
Modifications of templates for things like email are limited or tricky - especially if you are unfamiliar with coding.,,
Sometimes really cool features are disjointed.,,
En el Academy,,
"There is a learning curve, as it is a robust system, but they have very helpful training videos.",support:UX,
"I usually do not have time to do that since I am working on other projects, and wish that they could submit it themselves and put my name as a recommendation or that I agree that it should be added.",,
It's a little confusing at first to setup.,,
but I can't port over forms or contact properties.,,
"A rule that applies in one area may not apply in another, and it is confusing.",,
"Emails are easy to set up and send to your list.

"I’d say that on the marketing end, they’re just missing an approval workflow.",,
I'd like a more robust interface where it takes me into the social platform itself and I can dive deeper into engagement.,integrations:features:Actionable,
I will say there is a bit of a learning curve.,,
It is super buggy and hard to use.,,
Having to learn a new coding program (Hubl) in order to do web coding.,,
I have been using Hubspot for about 3-4 years now,,
"We are paying customers and when I had a problem with payment, I was told to read the FAQs next time I had an issue (I reached out over social media) the FAQs never would have answered my issue.",Actionable:features:support,
"but if you use SalesForce, you are better off using Pardot.",,
It's a very great tool.,,
Our year spent using Hubspot has been an absolutely terrible experience all round.,,
"Analytics data can sometimes be confusing, but the product is constantly being upgraded, so this is improving.",,
"The Marketing Emails provide so many more options, while the Sales Templates are not near as appealing or flexible. 
",,
"Other than that, Hubspot is not only about selling the software, but also help us guide through the process.",,
With that it would also be good to know what pitfalls occur within in workflows.,,
"I think a standardization across all tools is very needed.
",,
Pinterest is a HUGE platform that we use as a business and Hubspot does not support it in their Social setting.,,
The tracking is also confusing.,UX,
"Previews are affected by how optimised the linked page is.
",,
"The only downside that I would like to mention is that in Projects, Description allows edit but it must show the time of last change made and name of the person who does the edit.",,
"However, this is generally only a matter of a time delay before this catches up.",,
"I learned that without a solid plan, the tool is not necessary.  ",,
The blog template is hard to customize and you have to spend more money to get a better template that's functional - on top of all the money we spend right now for the enterprise.,,
Hubspot would add a HUGE link to the end of all my emails,,
"It is frustrating not being able to move things around easily on landing pages, emails, etc.",,
"Too expensive, though!",price,
"Granted, that could take away from the personalized feel of personally calling them, but it would make it easier for sure!",,
"All around, in attempting to achieve much, it seems like each arm of Hubspot is not as powerful as it would be had we gone with individual providers.",,
"There is a free version, however it is missing a lot of key features such as email templates.",,
There isn't anything I dislike about hubspot.,,
I dislike how you're not able to curate a list of people to send follow-up emails to based on in,features:Actionable:wishes,
sometimes it just has a little error.,,
It's not inexpensive.,,
I spend a fair amount of time wondering where things are.,,
"For me, HubSpot is trying to be something much larger than what it actually is.",,
Wish outside of original contact source could track source that drives most recent conversion or purchase action.,,
All I've had were good experiences!,,
Landing Pages could be better.,,
I would have to say that only enterprise allows A/B testing.,,
"In general, though, I would add that it's tough to find one solution that does everything well.",,
and I would love to be able to use it as an editorial calendar .,,
It does what it says on the tin..,,
"But since they have launched the beta trial of their live chat support, it has made troubleshooting a lot easier.",,
and i copy and paste in HS,,
"I've been told they issue no refunds at all, they want to keep the full fee for the year despite very little work on their side.
",,
Sometimes emails don't format correctly when you send through the test emails.,,
"We sometimes reach the limits on hubspot when it comes to multilanguage features or large enterprise needs (several business units, but only one community possible).",,
I don't get the Design Tools and the way it works.,,
"Without the extra coding assistance, I would not have as nice looking templates as I do now.",,
"The main downsides are that the platform changes a lot - which, although is important for development, it can cause disruptions and delays in the workplace.",,
"In addition, some tools allow you to select multiple items and mass edit while other tools do not.",,
"I like the way, I can just clone the landing page and retain everything it had and clone and edit the template and make anything out of it.",,
"There are typically workarounds for many of their deficiencies, but they do have room for improvement with the emails.",,
I know its difficult due to privacy policies on different platforms but there are certain features and tools that are integrated with some platforms but not others.,,
"They assured us that Hubspot would integrate with some of our programs when, in reality, they did not.",,
"Ability to organize based on company
",,
The only thing i dislike about HubSpot is that you are unable to create an email template and send it to multiple recipients at once.,,
They have a basic walkthrough you can do but it barely scratches the surface.,,
I work with teams of people and ideal production workflows look great on paper but rarely execute ideally.,,
There's very little I dislike about Hubspot.,,
"The HubSpot team created some customized templates for our company, but when I tried to tinker with them, they seemed to break easily.",,
"Also, customer service can be hit or miss",,
Right now the reporting is broken out at a higher level:,,
Hubspot can be expensive for a smaller business.,,
Having the ability to schedule out social media posts for the upcoming week in advance in the social media resource in HubSpot provides me with the time I would like to manage community engagement and react in a timely manner.,wishes:updates:features:Actionable,
"You can build (after the academy courses) your own outbounding strategy from workflow , sequences until the wright emails and followups.

I am not a fan of having to pay extra for the reporting add-on.,,

"No wrap around text in email editor.

"Price is super high for a small company at $200/month + onboarding fee to start I also wish they had their own live chat that I could turn on with the flick of a switch.
",,
Two would be the ability to build out an intranet page.,,
I wish there were more options for non-paying members.,,
I think there should be more standardization in the internal organization of HubSpot tools.,,
"It's just pretty pricey, sometimes having so many options is overwhelming and it takes more time to set everything up.",,
"When creating emails, I would appreciate more freedom and flexibility in terms of adding photos and text without a structured template (think photoshop accessibility-- free to put things wherever you see fit.)",,
"As a product, I feel it fits better there.",,
Sometimes a bit difficult to customize.,,
Actually in everything I used Hubspot for I have never been really disappointed.,,
"All in all, HubSpot's look & feel is not very consistent.",,
i did not really find any difficulty using this as a product.,,
I can hardly say something I dislike about HubSpot.,,
"We are already taking the time to answer the questions, we don't need this extra word count - yeah ... done.",,
"One issue is the price, which could be too much for starting businesses.",price,
This has caused tremendous issues with my marketing automation programs.,,
"They want you to use their proprietary tracking.
",,
"First, you cannot post image carousels (multiple images in one post) to Instagram via the HubSpot platform.",,
You won't see what it looks like until you preview it.,,
It isn't a big concern for us though.,,
"The reports tools could also be better - This might be a fixable problem, but I can't report on a group of contacts based on OR logic, it has to be AND logic.",,
"We have had some issues with chatflows, they honestly seem to piss off more people who interact with them than it does help them.",,
It's difficult to switch back and forth between templates and a new landing page to get it just right for the content you want to use.,,
For what I use it for--emailing and sharing contacts--it is perfect.,,
(number of days),,
"While it is possible to change almost all the elements, usage of the knowledge base and some hardcore HTML/JS/CSS skills are required 
",UX,
Difficult to navigate the analytics.,,
also sometimes I find searching people wont work all the time,UX:bugs:Actionable,
I have not found many problems with HubSpot just that some of the technical support could be better times.,,
It's WELL WORTH the effort of getting HubSpot set up.,,
It would be helpful if we could tag individuals in posts created in HubSpot.,,
The only small thing is I wish they would allow deals data to update company and contact data,,
There are sometimes messages prompting you to turn on HubSpot in your email that get annoying.,,
"When I have any question at all, I use the chat support line.",support,
"It's a pain, really.",,
Wish you could go a little more customized with those.,,
The quality of the reports are not to my liking since sometimes it is difficult to obtain specific data to be able to optimize campaigns.,,
Social media accounts need periodic reconnecting which is a pain.,,
"There's not an easy link to finding the buyer personas to update them, even though they are stored on the marketing dashboard.",,
"Also, adding the pixels into your website have been a little difficult for tracking customers.",,
The hard part is fully customizing the navigation from our current navigation because it was completely custom before.,,
Check their BBB report.,,
"The platform does not allow adding integrations with automated metrics tracking platforms, as in the case of google analytics.",wishes:Actionable:features:integrations,
This is the exception rather than the norm however.,,
I also dont like that with the gcal integration the edits you make to the invite in hubspot are reflected on the prospects side of the invite.,,
"Limited analytics
",,
"I don't enjoy having to scroll back and forth, and having to zoom in and out all the time on more long-winded workflows.",,
It lacks some customization options and it may be a little redundant at times.,,
I wish it had the ability to track multiple emails within one email.,Actionable:wishes:features,
"Not always as flexible as I'd like (with the simplicity you lose some of the ""fancier"" things you can do with custom coding).",,
"Just give it the time that it needs, read the manuals, hacks and everything available and then get on doing the task you want to.",,
It seems we don't have nearly as much control as we would like to connect data via the connector.,,
There's been a few glitches I've run into.,,
There are a lot of product changes that often feel unnecessary.,,
"HubSpot covers all the bases, but I don’t think they will have all the best features across every channel.",,
"Sometimes, the source code erases when pasting the content in the resource section from notepad or word document.",,
"a la herramienta de prueba de páginas A / B. Después de usar algo tan simple como MailChimp, Hubspot definitivamente tiene un poco de una curva de aprendizaje.",,
"Right now if you want to host more than two, there is a $700 charge for each additional domain.",,
"HubSpot is a great marketing automation tool, there isn't anything I dislike about it.",,
"- Landing Page Builder and Design Manager, HTML capabilities
",,
I would prefer that Hubspot have a to-do list capability that would allow users to see all assigned tasks as a pop-up when first logging in.,,
You are forced into paying for training even if you have used CRM's before.,,
There are features I'd love to see within HS like the ability to post videos to social and easier coding for landing pages.,,
The SEO/web site analytics facet could offer more insights into competitor web sites,,
"Key datapoints are present, but as it is a newer product (Hubspot Ads) there are signs of it's infancy, however it appears to be progressing at an acceptable pace.",,
Will probably book a meeting with our account manager to clarify this point.,,
so I don't have to jump from platform to platform.,,
I'm not really a fan of the design manager part of HS.,,
Luckily there are so many classes and helpful videos in HubSpot Academy that you'll quickly be finding your way around.,,
Attribution could also be improved.,,
A few times they have made changes on their side that have affected our inbound lead flows and broken them.,,
"I didn't get much on the form, mostly people looking for jobs, rather than potential customers, so I realized I needed to improve my marketing, but didn't have the time to spend much effort on that (I am running a startup, so time is limited), so the experiment was placed on hold.",,
Inserting a picture?,,
We all did it.,,
I do not like the new Beta View.,,
"One example for this is the landing page creator, which really needs a revamp to be fully flexible.",,
"Workflows are beyond limited and there are way too many steps to needed to create ""workarounds"" for most basic nurture campaigns..",,
There is room for improvement with some integrated apps,,
"Also, reporting can sometimes",,
Hubspot knows this fact but lack of mobile responsible tool is not what I expected.,,
The mobile medium needs to be easier to access and have similar functions to the computer medium.,,
"Superb Integration with other tools
",,
No images/content shown.,,
"I also do not like they way I cannot organize my emails, lists or website pages effectively.",,
It can sometimes be seen that new functions are released without equivalent reporting capability.,,
Very high & limits contacts and email sends.,,
Every other day when it does not work.,,
Once we did it was much easier to use.,,
The fact that sometimes the page from a lead is so long that I have to scroll some minutes to arrive to the beggining,,
I would love to be able to easier change dates and times by simply dragging and dropping or something of that nature.,,
It's a fairly pricy product and Hubspot takes a bit longer than I would hope to take on some of the customers feedback.,,
UI is terrible as long names of objects are clipped so you can't differentiate between 2 versions of the same thing.,,
"not having language variations in blogs, hub dp doesn't update after editing.",,
"For example, you have to create a custom field for custom lead statues",,
"The templates are great for emails, and it makes it easy to manage email marketing, sales, and our website!",,
"HubSpot's content-based metrics is very helpful for A/B testing and to see what is working better than others, etc.",,
"Also the compatibility with SalesForce is poor as well, which leads to even more manual work on my part.",,
It would be nice to edit it straight from the page or at least a bigger box.,,
For example a half split payment would make a big difference.,,
"While it has a lot of benefits, it does lack the flexibility and ability to do what some of the more well established CRM solutions offer.",,
"There is a large forum/idea platform where users can submit ideas/feedback, which everyone can vote for to prioritise the ideas towards HubSpot.",,
It has taken us 6 months to get to grips with and truly leverage the full power of the platform.,,
I struggled with the if/then branches and with setting goals initially.,,
"It can do wonders, but to do that you'll first have to enable yourself enough to do so.",,
I love the COS platform and I wish it was included in the platform / software price.,,
"It seems a little intimidating at first, when you first start looking around the site.",,
"• Tons of education and support
",,
Hubspot is almost there but will be best for less sophisticated business cases.,,
I much prefer Wordpress as a CMS and mailchimp for email marketing over hubspot.,,
Nothing for now the software is okay and works perfectly well,,
The mobile app still needs a little work specifically the chat feature (which I love).,,
"I realize some of these limitations are out of HubSpot's control, but having to use a separate platform to publish videos or tag locations is a huge pain in the neck.",,
We have given it over 1.5 years with Hubspot and have had to hire one of their consultants (spending an additional $1500 to have them assist us with best practices).,,
Coz setting up the initial tabs in every important to get things going.,,
"Some of the questions we have don't have intuitive answers in terms of funnel management, where leads are really coming from (by page), etc.",,
We spot them and quickly delete the newly created company record.,,
There are some features that I wish they had but it takes forever for implementation.,,
Accessing footer editing took me a while to work out as well as editing nav bar changes but with practise i've got a lot quicker.,,
So your emails could not be delivered because they hard bounced when they were sent an email from anyone of Hubspot customers using their tool.,,
"The apps for mobile and tablet aren't sufficient versions of the desktop version, and since i want to do a lot of my marketing work on my iPad Pro on the road, this gets really frustrating",,
The cost of add-ons is too high.,,
the Marketing Hub as whole.,,
The Hubspot chatbot is extremely limiting.,,
"I know that they are available a lot, but there are quite a few times when I need to chat with someone right now and chat will be unavailable.",,
"The email marketing tools could use updating, they lack some basic features that other providers such as mailchimp, sendy, etc have.",,
"Compared to these tools, HubSpot is not intuitive and lacks some features.",,
The basic reporting and the advanced versions need to be further improved.,,
Editing and formatting your web page.,,
This then caused confusion and made me look very unprofessional.,,
The styling restraints!!!,,
but we've been able to use them and see how it works for our organization.,,
"however, in my experience, HubSpot is already working on these ""setbacks"" and/or they integrate with the standalone software.",integrations,
Support asks you to log your own feature requests instead of passing them on to the product team for you.,,
It's starting to get to be a bit pricey.,,
It tends to overpower from the start as there are a ton of alternatives and a great deal of approaches to incorporate a crusade.,,
"This adds up quickly, if you keep in mind that you have to keep everyone stored here, even useless contacts who have unsubscribed or opted out.",,
"For the CRM, I don't see drawbacks.",,
There is a lot of features but it's simple to use.,,
"It can be intimidating, daunting, and almost too robust.",,
Workflows can go more in depth with options regarding contact activity to make marketing efforts even more personalized.,,
My current downside with HubSpot is the difficulty in syncing with our CRM - Microsoft Dynamics.,,
But to conclude that the integration between the sales and marketing is so great.,,
I do believe that there is a learning curve that will take a bit of time to get familiar with everything and use it to its fullest potential.,,
You also can't change the reply-to email to be different from the sender.,,
They've been battling with Marketo for the top spot year after year.,,
"It's like the jack of all trades platform for marketing, but I think most people are moving towards more elegant tools that are separate but super powerful for their purpose.",,
Some of the design and layouts modifications can be tricky to understand.,,
"When I need to publish more than one image to LinkedIn, I have to go to the platform and publish in real time, meaning that I have to remind myself to do it.",,
This makes strategy conversations difficult and can ultimately limit the type of service you provide based on the package tier your client chooses.,,
Does not integrate natively with MS Dynamics and needs a 3rd party integrator.,,
"Sometimes some issues happened like, Last time PayPal integration was not working for 10-11 days and because of that we faced many problems.",integrations:Actionable:bugs,
It seems at times as though they have over-engineered certain aspects of the UI and removed some functionality that I previously found helpful.,,
"One could ask for more features within the free version, but that is it.",,
"I do agree that it is worth the money, but if you're a smaller sized business the price tag might seem extremely out of range.",,
I would actually recommend getting your blog and/or social media pictures from sites like pexels and pixabay.,,
"I don't like the emails, it's really hard to make a nice design or if  i have my own text templates on google drive",,
"Forced to use subdomains for blogs, glitches in interface",,
Asked to pay an additional $100 a month to achieve basic functionality only after we signed contract.,,
I haven't been able to really get them to work well for some automated projects.,,
"Hubspot provides tons of useful content for better understanding how marketing works in general, but the software itself doesn't always seem too tailored to our business needs without heavy consultation with Hubspot SMEs.",,
"We are using the paid service for a few seats, but with limited email response times for support, we are going back to something else.  ",,
Their chat function is also limiting for our needs.,,
I am always reaching for the statistics that I would like but am unable to achieve them.,,
At the time the email design feature can feel too rigid with it's set templates however this is the payoff for ease of use.,,
"you normally think of, because it still involves coding in some way.",UX,
I would like To have it more integrated...in order to garantee that MQLs are reflected to management team.,,
The email and landing page creation tools - having to create templates to design anything is a PAIN and a drag & drop feature would be MUCH EASIER.,,
I don't like the limited customization.,,
That makes things very cluttered at times.,,
I do wish it would include for us where our website clicks are coming from.,,
"For example, it would be wonderful if the media/content library was better organize for user experience and upload along with a better catalog of searching capabilities.",,
You will always find few technical issues/bugs when using software or tools etc..,,
Has never given me trouble.,,
HubSpot is too rigid and the system is built so you have to conduct email marketing/marketing automation in the HubSpot way.,,
"Honestly, I don't have anything I dislike.",,
"It would be great to have the ability to tag individual people on Linkedin (not sure if this is a privacy issue), to be able to enable twitter cards from the blog, and to have some kind of marketing expert/guide to help you use the app as with Hootsuite/Facebook.",features:Actionable:wishes,
"So, if I send out a national marketing email for one of my sales guys, I can't have the responses go out to him.",,
"There are some features that we wish were available, certain reports, different ways to sort contacts, etc.",,
"But if you can afford it, it's amazing.",,
"However, this is where the top-notch customer service benefits us.",,
"I'm not as impressed with their CMS program, which they call HubSpot COS.",,
We always have to get them custom formatted.,,
For some tasks where coded i needed it can be a little bit tricky to understand Hubl code,,
Also there's some operational issues like lack of multiple timezone support for accounts.,,
"Also, prices are not very affordable.",,
You need to actively manage costs for it not to spiral out of control.,,
"We continue to learn more, use more features and add more users.",,
"The website software within HubSpot is a bit different than most, such as Square Space or WordPress.",,
"Sometimes some views have automatically loaded twice for a few weeks (as if you'd push F5 for refresh twice), making you wait a tiny bit longer until you can use the controls in the view (such as list of webpages or blog posts on your site).
",,
"Sometimes some tools will be moved around without my knowledge, and I need spend some time to refamiliarize myself.",,
"All in all, no problems yet, still working to figure out the best techniques.",,
"The pricing is pretty high compared to other things, so the customer has to see the value.",,
I can always speak to someone on the support team in under 5 minutes at any time.,,
Sometimes you want to use all their products as they work seamlessly together,,
We could also use the ability to make child and parent lists so that you can work your way down audiences.,,
You also are limited in terms of what you can do unatively versus natively.,,
You definitely need a single person devoted to the inbound activity on the platform.,,
"Hubspot sometimes has bugs and kinks that need to be worked out, but their support team is easy to work with.",,
"But I would like to see more options added in the setting of form completion such as changing contact property value, lead score etc.",,
"I asked the firm why we needed to sign up so early in the project, we hadn't even agreed upon messaging.  ",,
"In summary, it became much easier to have our team working on a single platform, with the same metric techniques and business analysis throughout the sales funnel process.",,
I've noticed that dropping multiple pictures into emails and formatting them is a little tricky.,UX:Actionable,
It's all manual.,,
"Also, it would be great to get a monthly newsletter when new features are added.",,
"Since the update done in Jan there have been a lot of bugs that have affected me being able to use HubSpot without running into a problem every other week, and slow follow-up response time when issue aren't able to be resolved when on the phone.",,
"Though it is a fantastic tool and has great support, other solutions have won business through their ability to offer just as good if not better support for a more affordable price.",,
"It works well for what I need it to do, plus the ability to then trigger emails is invaluable to me.",,
My inbox is saturated enough without getting notified of every tiny thing that happens in hubspot.,,
It steps up quite steeply to access all features and sometimes it's hard to prove ROI for the higher price bracket.,,
It also involves in mail tracking and automation of the mails.,,
"Some key integrations are missing, as the one with Likeding Lead Gen Forms.",,
I have to call support another time to see if someone else understands my end goal question or I am just sent to an article to refer to.,,
I think it needs more flexibility,,
There is also usually a pretty long wait time to get someone on the phone.,,
Nothing like that as it provides to maintain and increase leads.,,
"Also, HubSpot is a MASSIVE tool, and I definitely had a pretty substantial learning curve to get started.",,
"From visual point of view, customisation to adapt the fonts, colors and look and feel of the forms, mailings, etc... is not as easy at it seems at the beginning.",,
There isn't much I dislike about HubSpot.,,
Our business uses Salesforce contact records heavily which makes it challenging to sync data between both systems.,,
and I can't commit to the dozens of hours that would be required to become even remotely comfortable.,,
"This makes development a little slower - but the tradeoff is that once a template is designed, it can easily be used over and over again.",,
"Some feature that feel like no brainers are disable, i think to protect their pricing model, but they should be there.",,
The initial setup can be a bit tedious in regards to templates.,,
"Creating a campaign and associating all activities to it including email campaigns, social media posts, landing pages ..",,
I wish there were more social posting capabilities.,Actionable:wishes:features:UX,
"Though there is nothing as such to dislike about Hubspot itself, there are things such as Hubspot marketplace which is still at very basic, though it is growing but at present you will not find amazing buy and use resources.",,
"There are certain features that we need, but they are not developed.",,
My only complaint is that you don't get a ton of flexibility from the platform.,,
Lack of conversion stats - would be nice to get a percentage conversion i.e of calls/activities to meetings,,
"Oftentimes I crave more customization from Hubspot, in terms of what workflows, fields, and integrations I think would benefit our organization.",,
This is such a critical part of the tool yet it does not seem that much effort or work has gone into this.,,
But their support team is super responsive and they are very proactive in addressing customer issues.,,
This is one major area in which Intercom clearly outshines Hubspot.,,
I use HubSpot daily for hours on end and have never run into any issues.,,
"Also, sometimes the plugin doesn't work on desktop (in Gmail), despite being live and installed.",,
I would like the reporting system to be more specific.,,
The user interface can be a bit confusing.,,
the other applications do.,,
There are so functionality that are just better in other tools so while HubSpot offers them (chatbot + live chat),,
"I felt it easier to build my own LPs using another service.
",,
"Getting started is a bit overwhelming, and there is not a really concise searchable knowledgebase to access for the many nitty gritty questions that come up with the set up.",,
The new domain name connection fee is insane.,,
Modifying and customizing emails has been a challenge for me.,,
"As Hubspot grows, it continues to fracture its pricing model and hide more and more features behind ""Add-on"" paywalls.",,
"Also, when reporting, I would like an option for multi-currency payments to be added, as we currently operate on several countries.",,
Cost is too high for small businesses on the marketing platform.,,
"I would like to fully dive into Hubspot, but I can't quite afford it yet.",,
"Good place to post tweets, but not as good as Tweet Deck.",,
"For example, I will add the website link for LinkedIn or Twitter for a new contact and after I have saved it",,
I also didn't love the change they made to the html email design process.,,
It could use some work on ease of use as it can be confusing at times.,,
Having to log on to a desktop in order to send out a tweet is a pain.,,
I wish that chat support was online 24/7.,,
Sometimes HubSpot Support is slow to answer when you open a ticket through email.,,
"The learning curve is not too terrible and the community of users is awesome as well as HubSpot Academy, If you are a self-learner, it's easy to hack around in. 
",,
The CRM system is a little light and a bit kludgy.,,
"All of the ""custom templates"" they make you look exactly the same.",,
Because I'm in the software constantly I run into bugs sometimes.,,
Often it takes a while to successful launch new tools and their sales tools are tough to use with a larger sales team that wants to use tools that HubSpot doesn't yet offer,,
I work very closely with the sales team and sometimes there are reports we can't create that we were able to in Microsoft Dynamics,,
"An example is the workflow - that you need to remake stuff, instead of copying.",,
"There aren't many things I dislike about HubSpot, but if I had to be really nit-picky it would be the fact that things are constantly changing..",,
"I also don't like the lead tracking, but mostly because I use Wix to host my website.",,
"The other negative would be that the customization process for the email template is very different from the landing page, which seems counterintuitive to me.",,
There have not been any complaints from anybody on our team.,,
May need to do a bit my research on my end for the future.,,
Until then I could say that there will be the same experience in terms of using this tool.,,
"I wouldn't say I ""dislike"" this aspect, but its definitely a commitment to get started with inbound marketing and keep things moving forward.",,
He notado que puedo realizar muchas cosas dentro de Hubspot y,,
but there isn't as much of a free selection as I would like.,,
The reporting has been a real issue for us up to this point.,,
Professional plan pricing which includes social media features is formidable for small business owners with 1-5 employees.,,
"For example, we have multiple websites managed in one Hubspot portal and it's a challenge to use the traffic and lead reports in Hubspot since it does not differentiate between websites, only sub-domains.",Actionable:bugs:integrations,
There's a slightly difficult learning curve for a new user.,,
I had a little problem learning all that I wanted to learn at first but after some use I understood most of it.,UX,
"Another difficulty about this software is that marketing automation is very difficult to use, and you cannot get accurate data from HubSpot.",,
"Paid Search, Paid Social.",,
There are also some small details that I would love to see included.,,
There's also room for improvement in the granularity of the reporting.,,
Can't function properly as an email campaign software which would be more valuable for the companies I've worked with.,,
Moreover the support is super reactive and useful.,,
"Might be a little challenging to use Hubspot to its' full potential, as I said, it is pretty much possible to do anything with it",,
"You can't tell who has deleted items, can't rearrange certain columns when viewing records (no particular rhyme or reason to this limitation).  ",,
It finds it had to keep up with frequent software changes.,,
"We've run into glitches more often than we'd like, but their support team has been able to resolve most of them pretty fast.",,
The Instagram posting has no feature to tag accounts in the image uploaded.,,
"I wish we could segment analytics by business unit. 
",,
It took a while to revert it back to,bugs,
"But finally, HubSpot is coming with a solution.
",,
"Keeping data clean, cross-checking, and ensuring prospects do not get double touched can be difficult.",,
I also do not like the fact that integrating the marketing features with other services provided by the company is expensive.,,
This tool is amazing and makes my job easier.,,
"Additionally, SEO checklists like those offered on competing platforms, while not missing, are obscure and easy to miss in the UI.",,
"When scheduling I don’t like that after you select the platform you are scheduling to, you cannot delete it if it’s a mistake or decide that you don’t want to use it.",,
I would like it if HubSpot made it so that you can attach more than one image in each social post.,,
Changing an email design or creating interesting looking mailshots is not as straight forward as it could be.,,
But you have to ask yourself whether the improved sales from a more data detailed approach offsets the higher cost.,,
Comes with the territory!,,
The only thing that's sometimes annoying is all the updates being made to the tool that require changing the daily routine.,,
"Kind of hard to get that there is three different places to edit the website and blog - both under Marketing > Website, in the design manager and in settings.",,
Things are consistently changing.,,
"Sales people hate CRMs, but of the ones we've tried, HubSpot seems to be having the greatest impact.",,
"HubSpot is definitely expensive, more expensive than my taste if we didn't have 90% off as a startup.",,
That is a lot to do with the system on our end though more then theirs.,,
"When I see something off, I always revert back to GA.",UX:bugs:Actionable,
There a few simple things that HubSpot can't do at the moment.,,
"Although I haven't tried the Workflow Automation, I believe there is room for improvement on the way sales development representatives should run their campaigns.",,
Sometimes I realize that what i want to do does not exist yet with hubspot - most of the time realize this via chat with support - and they suggest I leave a post for HubSpot community or suggestions.,,
I have more than once given up on troubleshooting a problem with my templates and handed over the task to Hubspot's customer service team.,,
"Some requests keep popping up over and over again in community forums, and it takes quite a lot to get them action",,
I can't schedule videos on social media posts.,wishes:Actionable:features,
The Reporting for campaigns on Social seems to be a bit wrong - not counting posts properly.,,
"Everything, they are predators.",,
Only other feedback is that it can be a bit daunting to learn.,,
The set up is a bit complicated and can get confusing when trying to create fields and,,
The mobile app needs to be more friendly.,,
I dislike how the free option doesn't let you trial run all the different variations of HubSpot.,,
There are some other platforms that don't connect or perfectly connect to Hubspot.,,
"While it can do so much, it's very difficult to learn everything.",,
There's no specific way to opt-out people from EDM subscriptions unless you manually opt them out completely.,,
In a situation where you have 18 plus sales staff it gets costly for startups.,price,
"The support and training in Hubspot Academy is superb, but you need to allow 30 hrs per week in the early days to truly understand how this can benefit your business.",,
There isn't much I don't like about Hubspot.,,
You must create all deals,,
If we could see actual pages visited and also get more user-specific details on the site traffic to allow for more targeted follow up that would be a beneficial feature we would take advantage of.,,
"It's like a video game, only some people know the cheat codes.",,
We also would like to classify different leads for different products.,,
"Hubspot would be even better with a more integrated flow between a contact and a deal, for example it would be great when working in a deal to have easier access to the contacts properties, such as phone, email, etc, so less toggling between the two. 
",,
Since I've come from using Marketo and Eloqua I sometimes miss the robustness of those tools.,,
but I understand that we don't want to flood our audience ;),,
I use HubSpot primarily for the marketing automation tool.,,
"I know it's not perfect, but what I know, and I can see every day, is that the Hubspot Team is always concerned about improving its services.",,
"Building the templates for landing pages is not my favourite task, it is hard to modify existing landing page's templates.",,
The Customer/Technical service is always ready to help us whenever we need their guidance.,,
It's obvious but they should understand that i.e. Wordpress has way more users.,,
However when some new features or capabilities are introduced it can be difficult to get to grips with them.,,
not having time to learn all they create,,
"Email automation isn't as robust as some other platforms, but you can still do plenty of workflows.",,
There are so many features and options that it takes a little time to create a working knowledge od how the system is operated.,,
/designing them is not very easy if you're not willing to purchase already made templates.,,
so I have no doubt,,
There are the incidental minor bothers like I wish I could change a couple of things about how a portion of the HubSpot created properties show up and are gathered.,,
"There have been cases when the platform doesn't suit our specific need, for instance in the case of setting up a chatbot given to a certain scenario.",,
"It also takes a long time to set-up and onboard properly, so it can be tough to really take advantage of the powerful platform for the first 6+ months.",,
Sometimes templates don't render well on mobile view- HubSpot should improve that.,,
"Perhaps this is user error, but it seems that we end up having about seven different pages for each contact.",,
We used it as a small company and because of that were not in a position to utilize it for all their features.,,
"Also, if you require ongoing technical support odds are you will have to pay for it.",,
I prefer a much more generalized approach with optional details.,,
"I would use the previous editor all the time, but the new one does not work well, so I have to make adjustments on my own program and reupload.",,
If you are a free user it is definitely very limiting so a paid subscription is a must.,,
We haven't quite figured out how to make the customer satisfaction surveys work for us but this functionality is fairly new within Hubspot so hopefully it will improve with time.,,
I'm hopefully HubSpot continues to build out reporting functionality for sequences.,,
All of the different parts of a campaign don't necessarily flow together as I would like.,,
Staff are great when trying to find the problems though.,,
There are so many fields to fill out when sending out an email from HubSpot!,Actionable:features:UX,
""" I find that the social media tool is lacking when compared to tools like Sprout Social and even newer tools like Zoho Social.",,
but luckily there is a good support on the knowledge website for that.,,
Something I would love to see more is customization on the home screen and also easier automation and smarter integration with phone calls and emails.,,
Probably not a huge issue for most people,,
"It's weird - there are some parts of Hubspot that are cutting-edge, very intuitive - and then there are uneditable landing pages and glitchy blog posts.",,
They only show their statuses in the funnel.,UX,
"The spell check isn't great, there are frequent updates that change the entire site (roughly twice a year)",,
"There are a few improvements that could be done to the platform in terms of email workflows.
",,
The least helpful part of HubSpot has been some of the reporting capabilities it lacks.,,
This would allow us to do so much more on a much simpler scale,,
"More types of content can be scheduled through the tool now, and the reporting is better, with more metrics.",,
"The platform lacks some basic functions (signatures on shared inbox, standard teamwide font settings, etc.)",,
"For example, when I want to report on either Contacts OR Deals, it only lets me see Contacts with Associated Deals, or the other way around.",Actionable:features:bugs,
Campaign functionality could be improved.,,
Reporting is limited.,,
"I also wish there was a way to access more Twitter features from the Publishing tool - like add multiple pictures, tag users in photos, use Twitter polls, or quickly and easily append GIFs.",,
I recommend anyone to try your free version as they will end up buying it.,,
"Reports/dashboards could be better, when building the website some of the code is automatically populated in a way that is difficult/frustrating to someone with experience",,
Some reports could be better and you can't link reports to dashboards; which is a bit of a letdown.,,
It's extremely frustrating and time consuming.,,
"I am able to not locate a little something that displeases me of HubSpot, it's an awesome program that works great, I have practically nothing adverse to state toward this amazing device.",,
"We are often in need of extra features that should be available for the rest of our team, but they cannot access them as they need to be upgraded to a higher user, which is currently unavailable due to budget constraints.",,
"It can sometimes take a while to achieve what you are trying to do, and it happened a couple times where we just couldn't do what we wanted to do, and their support team wasn't able to help at all.",,
The layout of the software is perhaps the only thing that is a bit flawed.,,
Their only recommendation was to turn off cookie tracking which is a huge function of HubSpot that would defeat the purpose of all the tracking ability.,,
"Always quick and informative, often with videos to explain how to make the improvements.",,
"Ties your CRM and marketing automation together seamlessly.
",,
"To edit a page you often have to edit something in design manager as well as on the basic template, and they don't always interact effectively.",,
Some times it has hiccups in the software where it does not 100% save.,,
The way HubSpot add UTMs to all of the ads URLs.,,
"However, I think that may be an issue with the Instagram API rather than HubSpot themselves.",,
"I appreciate having all the high-level tools I need in one place, but unless you have programming experience or some budget for custom things you'll risk looking amateurish.",,
But there is no way to get that information from HubSpot (except for a ridiculous workaround that involves exporting then importing lists).,,
"For example, ""alert"" command does not work.",,
We have 4 different fiscals and I have to update each report to match those fiscals every new fiscal there is no option for a rolling date option for a specific date.,,
The inability to resize images for appropriate social media posting in the social tools.,,
Notifications are probably my biggest dislike.,,
My team has had to rely heavily on their customer support team which is not always the most helpful.,,
"I wish there were a way to send automated calls to your contacts, reminding them about events and stuff like that.",wishes:Actionable:features,
"It is complicated in some places, so employees need training",,
"We are able to do everything we want, but it requires a lot of custom work on both the salesforce and hubspot sides of things.",,
I end up playing around with styles and spacing to get everything consistent.,UX:bugs,
"I use apple mail, and we later found out that Apple mail did not support this extension.  ",,
"Mostly that on the CTA screen, I can no longer see conversion data, just click data.",,
There are a lot of quirks that make things like deleting lists difficult.,,
Shortcuts would be great,,
"Honestly though, it is exciting to use a tool whose makers are constantly working to innovate.  ",,
"The reporting is a little cumbersome, but they have made massive improvements to this aspect in the past year.",,
"Even though it is a fairly intuitive interface once you've navigated through a bit, Hubspot can take that initial startup time to learn how to navigate.  ",,
"You can have only 10 reports per dashboard. 
",,
Certain features are limiting: lack of complexity in lead scoring and limited A/B testing with workflow emails.,,
"You can create your own emails from scratch using a building-block style creator to build your emails - or you can purchase a pre-made templates however both have some rather glaring flaws. 
",,
An example of which is that we can't prohibit users from editing templates - all users get access to this area.,,
The added on costs which apply if usin.,,
"While the interface is clean and easy to use, there is so much depth and detail in some sections.",,
"The personalization of almost everything is very good, It can take you more time to create everything as you imagine, but the possibility is there.
",,
It proves difficult for one to make corrections if they do not know shortcut keys for the required actions.,UX,
This is truly an amazing platform.,,
Also the software is a bit on the pricier side.,,
it's a little rigid in,,
"From what I hear, developer tools could be much better.",,
"Some features are still being developed, which can make it difficult to have a fully dynamic tool that can meet all sales and marketing needs.",,
I want to be able to build more dynamic dashboards/reports using contact properties.,,
There is no way to track a credit system in which a customer has a set number of credits and they use them throughout their contract so it makes customer management difficult.,,
"Once you get to a certain point, you really have to start hacking things together to make it work the way you'd like.",,
We do not like the free version of hubspot because it has very little capacity.,,
"I wasn't the biggest fan of their ""templates' for landing pages, emails and even the blog.",,
Tagging has to be done manually on the respective platforms after it gets posted.,,
Also unable to attach more than 1 company to a contact though you can attach more than 1 contact to a company.,,
"Every question I've had with Hubspot is either answered immediately, or a team of people look into it and get back to me, which is really great.",,
"There was quite some information available via the support community and HubSpot provided great support, but it took time to have everything up and running.",,
"Sometimes when someone submits their info via splash, hubspot will change their contact info and you have to go in and see what happened.",,
"Because it is a platform, the migration process is not always very precise for the websites.",,
I think that there should be hubspot training when you first login so you can maximize the tool.,,
"If i was going to say anything, I would say I wish there was more video content to be able to view - but honestly, that would be the only drawback I could consider.",,
It seems as if anytime I bcc anyone on an email it will just show up as someone viewed your email which does not help me too much.,,
"Now, the only support is email, with a one day turn around, or spend $200 a month.    ",,
Thankfully HubSpot's training academy is there to help you through it (although some of the videos can get long).,,
We were using HubSpot for social media but switched and use HootSuite now instead.,,
You will actually need to study and learn certain skills.,UX,
"Support isn't the best, I have contacted them twice about issues and it seems as if they just copy and paste what's in the FAQ's when you ask for help on a topic.",,
"There are sometimes when the software is launching, I get some bugs that are unexplained as I don't have another software running and the workstations has enough system resources available for the use of HubSpot.",,
"The integration with Salesforce can be difficult to manage, especially because HubSpot only uses Contacts, and only sees certain objects and not others.",integrations,
I'm keen to explore their bot making tools for Facebook and get really excited that their releases are so frequent.,,
Missing a few key features/functionalities like the ability to pause workflows and sort contacts based on certain criteria.,,
HubSpot Sales is not so efficient as platforms like Salesforce.,,
Gather and analyze data properly to know and understand how much impact and revenue a campaign created.,,
I am not sure and don't remember if HubSpot offered a tour or tutorial on how to use it.,,
This can make the process a little confusing for them and force them to use workarounds.,,
"Sometimes, it is like Hubspot is always under construction, but the updates are nice once you figure them out.  ",,
But it will display and say that theyre displaying correctly.,,
We don't really have many complaints about HubSpot.,,
It would be nice to just have one system for all lead tracking.,,
"Just-marketing plans can still be really pricey, too.
",,
The organization has been getting a little out of hand with the many various features for success.,,
"I'm using it to publish blog posts, manage landing pages, A/B test, share on social media, publish ads, run remarketing campaigns with smart lists and to push users back and forth between intercom and HubSpot.",,
Territory plays a big part in our sales process.,,
Trying to work with frameworks like Vue.JS in Hubspot's code editor is almost impossible.,,
"Also, clear properties to track utm parameteres would be much appreciated.",,
If you don't use a feature (e.g. Landing pages) you can't just remove it from your subscription plan.,,
The limitations of the email templates and design feature are not user friendly and we have hired outside developers to create emails for us so that our emails look less generic.,,
The free version has not been updated since a while now and also the paid version is a bit high priced.,,
How hard can this be to fix?!,,
"however, this makes it difficult to automate things and hub spot hasn't been the most helpful with this.",,
"Multiple rebrands, mean UI changes frequently.  ",,
I dislike that there isn't an alt-text option with Hubspot.,,
"For website management, the usability is poor.",,
"I do not enjoy the formatting or design-build of the web design portion of Hubspot either, specifically the blog posting.",,
As most of our email recipients use this platform our emails need to look best there and we went through quite the trial and error phase getting them to render.,,
Can make it difficult when we are trying to get a new person always up to speed.,,
I won't let that happen again.,,
"In order to create landing pages, you need to know some coding.",,
"HubSpot can get very costly, very quickly since the yearly bill is based on contacts.",,
Support and the SFDC integration is lacking,,
Editing templates can be daunting early on and the email editor often requires you to go into the code in order to properly format many operations.,,
"If you are a company that likes to be innovative and do creative things with your marketing, this is not for you.",,
"It offers you a wide range of options, from CRM, Sales and Marketing and they keep updating themselves often.
",,
There is also an issue with it accurately counting the emails opened.,,
so I hope they roll out the new versions soon.,,
"Whereas before I was able to send teams into the field and have them post to our social accounts while traveling, that feature has been removed from the app.",features:bugs:Actionable,
Tools like MailChimp are definitely more cost-effective.,alternatives:integrations:price,
"The lead nurture process is poor, and most of the time it involves a lot of manual work to be done.",,
We moved to HubSpot because of their great customer support.,,
right when you're creating website or landing pages to help us compete better with similar companies from a keyword/SEO perspective.,,
"Email collaboration can be difficult, as only one person can make changes at a time.",,
HubSpot CMS still needs a bit of work to ease the work for non-html users.,,
"I know that hubspot accepts integrations, but with the price that we pay we should have it as a primary function.",,
The website functionality is hindered by a lack of customization options (namely plugins) and there aren't too many affordable Hubspot developers out there.,,
I dislike that I can't always get a support employee on live chat.,,
it was completely FREE.,,
There are very few things I dislike about Hubspot.,,
"Their sales team reallllllly tries to sell you on the entire package, which is massive,extremely expensive, and completely unnecessary unless you are a giant company.",price,
I also really do not like how you reports or exports get emailed to you.,Actionable:features,
"In this way, we can personalize the marketing content and make sure that they'll get only info based on their interests.",,
it can be a shock at first if you're used to something different.,,
It seems wasteful on both sides.,,
The expense of the upgraded Marketing package is a bit out of a small business range.,,
"I dislike that once you get past the initial or minimum features, you'll start to get nickel and dimed on every turn.",,
"There are a couple of functions that HS can't perform... yet, but they are very minor.",,
"For our mid-size staffing company, we're forced to delete contacts every week in order to avoid the automatic increase in cost should they conduct one of their unannounced reviews of the account.",,
I like how its work for me.,,
Sometimes it can be a bit repetitive in viewing prrevious emails.,,
It is a little expspensive when comparing some other platforms.,,
"HTML editing skills are a bit difficult to handle at some point; While they offer a lot of plug and play, they also add random HTML to their emails that sometimes move things strangely, or at other times it is simply outdated.",,
Some new tools released don't appear to be tested and there are tiny nuances to each tool that if fixed or improved would help make each better - things like UI adjustments or 'speaking' to other tools in the suite.,,
but we are working on that with them.,,
The main drawback has been the learning curve of all the functions in what is a complex piece of software.,,
"I several months, and it would nor surprise me AT ALL if Hubspot fixed it in this time zone.",,
but we chose to have someone help with our setup.,,
"It would be nice if you can export the content calendar, to view marketing efforts within an excel version.",,
It is not best recommended for big companies.,,
"I don't like that I can't add a form to an external webpage, like in Wordpress, and have it be trackable inside of my campaign.",,
Seems like there is some functionality missing.,,
"However you are able to turn the notifications off its just hard becuase some emails you need to see, and some you dont, however they bothf all under the same sub category to turn them off.",,
Once we get the templates after the migration it is impossible to change them and I struggle to use the templates at the marketplace when I need to keep our headers and footers.,,
"Lead scoring was limited to tracking only Hubspot engagement activities and couldn't integrate sales activities from Salesforce (i.e. calls, emails, demos, etc.).",,
"There are limited font, color, and other formatting options in some but not all of the marketing tools.",,
I had to go click and edit it one-by-one.,,
"For example, an email was sent to someone who was not part of the list that was attached to it, and trying to create sequences within a folder never works, it always has to be moved into the folder, which caused me a lot of confusion at first.",,
"For this reason, we needed to continue to use our outside live chat program.",,
right now it saves the draft and,,
"The HTML editing abilities are a bit difficult to handle sometime; while they offer a great deal of plug and play, they also add random HTML to your emails that sometimes moves things in odd ways, or at other times is simply outdated.",,
"Sometimes the posts do not make it to publish and end up in an ""unsuccessful"" folder.",,
"I definitely feel that working in automatic suggestion to link the different levels (company, contact, deal) would be a great relieve to work on it.",,
Its faster to type a name without an accent and see it anyways.,,
Sale and Marketing is all about reaching to many clients and customers and this tool has given us that platform.,,
so you have to stay on top of these updates to get the most out of the software,,
There is a lot of heavy lifting involved to get all needed assets set up.,,
"The learing center is quite caotic, and the features are many, it can be discouraging at first.",,
I would like to have more options when it comes to the design and modification of the Lead Capture Forms.,,
The payment plan of the software is costly for users with tons of contacts.,,
"If it was changed via a list, tell me which list, if it was changed because someone signed up on a landing page, tell me which one.",,
But entirely worth it.,,
so I don't mind.,,
"I wish that the templates were a bit more flexible so we could create ones not available in the system - however, the option to work with a designer is quite nice and have used that service several times.",,
Have not found a room to add general notes on accounts yet,,
"For example, their Sales tool used to be very shallow; however now it is a quality Sales tool with a good degree of customization.",,
We have been using HubSpot for over 6 months now and are extremely pleased.,,
"I wish there were more social media platforms like Pinterest, able to post videos for Instagram, Facebook stories, & Snapchat.",wishes:Actionable:features:integrations,
"There isn't an apparent way to upload the images straight into a folder while also placing it as a featured image, so our files have gotten pretty messy.",,
"When I update a featured image on my WordPress site for a page I'm posting about, it usually takes up to 24 hours for the new image to come through",,
"You can see stats of your emails and communication.
",,
"slow when building lists, slow in sending large emails, missing in depth campaign analytics, there is no more back button in the email (the hamburger at the top adds a lot of time when the back button should still be there), there should be analytic opportunities for hublys",wishes:bugs:UX,
"Also, one cannot deploy emails in batches based on timing, such as sending only 5,000 emails per hour.",,
A few of the view are still using the old UI,,
"Additionally, we sometimes have some problems with the Salesforce integration.",integrations,
this then makes it harder to have a broad range of easy to use templates.,,
Also being unable to comment on posts once uploaded,,
They are somewhat difficult to figure out and in addition we are limited to only 20 reports.,,
"While the ROI can be realized in a short time, it is still hard to swallow the price you pay.",price,
"Currently any time someone becomes a new lead, their source is updated with the most current lead source.",,
With so many moving parts it can be easy feeling a little overwhelmed with how the pieces connect and function.,,
this feature doesn't really work.,,
I liked Hubspot a lot once I had been trained on how to use it.,,
"They limit a lot of your capabilities if you're not paying, which sucks but is also important.",,
Nothing is perfect and when a perfect strives to do close to everything there must be compromises.,,
"As it is so easy to create new content, templates, stylesheets and sometimes also overly complicated workflows and lists, managing the account proves a challenge.",,
"Overall though, I don't have any complaints.",,
Tiered pricing locks away some features.,,
"Early on their interface and uptime were not great, but in recent updates, they have made huge strides.",updates,
Also email alerts don't always work.,,
"Very good email building and design capabilities, and data on the individual emails is also great.",features,
We have 13 branches and each branch would like certain privacy associated with the contact information that they recieve.,,

"For example, after a networking event I have to manually communicate.",,
I dislike that you cant embed GIFs or videos in emails yet and that they are not supported in Outlook,,
"Reporting capabilities are limited and slow - though I believe they offered ""premium"" reporting services at a higher cost now.",,
Some of the UI can be a little cumbersome and not as intuitive as some other tools.,,
I am still not using it at maximum.,,
Filters in the dashboard are very restricted.,,
It's not perfect for some of the ways we use it (,,
Social media posting is very limited.,,
It's also quite expensive for a small business.,,
"In addition, turnover seems to be high at Hubspot HQ as we have had a new account rep every year that I have been a customer.",,
""" If I knew it would populate the link preview correctly once the URL is live, I would just schedule the post.",,
"They do not have the same reporting capabilities as Salesforce missing the ""or"" filter.",,
Some of the reporting features are not useful.,,
If your employer is willing to spend more money on a platform that actually works do that.,,
Maybe hubspot can ease that connection.,,
"they some how miraculously ""are not available for chat once I am writing a chat to them"" and you cant bulk enroll people into sequences you have to do it manually",,
"So far, there isn't really anything that we dislike!",,
"The pricing (even with Professional, which is pricey) leaves much to be desired - you need to pay extra for pretty much standard things like customizing deal amounts, reports etc.",,
"It's really trial and error for the first few, what sort of data you want collected from each campaign, etc.",,
"When you don't have a full UX design/development staff, it can be difficult to work with some of the templates and still create the functionality you need.",,
"Example: For users who are not very technical and developing a good custom email template is a pain-point, buying out an email template is not an option, because everything in marketplace is non-impressive.",,
Cannot look up an account by phone number or street address,,
It's a little difficult to sync up with Outlook 365 in a corporate environment.,,
"Since we are a hospital and not an online retailer, it is a little more tricky to track conversions and closed deals.",,
costly if you use all the bells and whistles if your client numbers go up -,,
Not so much of a dislike as a lack of use.,,
I did not like that I had to either call into support of get on the list to be contacted if I was having an issue.,UX:Actionable:support,
Still need a little work on the dashboard on the application.,,
"It would be great if campaigns tool is more customizable or can include manual data.
",,
"Usually, there's a quick resolve time but seems to happen quite often.",,
I think it is a little clunky and there can be a plethora of more design and editing options- things like drag and drop are finally in demo but that should have been put in place awhile ago.,,
Not very honest in my opinion.,,
- Calendar which is very helpful and the integration with google calendar is very easy.,,
I have to go somewhere to set up an audience of the campaign rather than doing it right from the email I'm sending.,,
"Also, the deals and contacts/companies do not listen to each other and you cannot create an entire workflow because they have limited capabilities (",,
The spacing of modules can be a bit difficult sometimes to adjust.,,
"Well, it's not a complaint, more a developing suggestion.",,
Our company is doing something to go about the main problem and that is stabilizing our connection for the good of our business.,,
A strong dislike I have is that I am not notified when my social posts fail.,,
No issues day to day.,,
The hubspot lessons on inbound marketing and other hubspot lessons are very repetitive.,,
"For sales, I would recommend Salesforce instead.",,
There's not much I dislike!,,
a adesão e depois compra do software.,,
Our marketing firm (ex) pushed us to sign a one year contract.,,
Hubspot doesn't integrate well with our business model.,integrations,
I wish that was easier to work with.,UX:wishes,
Also their social media monitoring does not capture a lot of the engagement that we actually receive on social media so you still need to log in (especially to Twitter) to check engagement.,,

"I dislike the website builder, upon connecting my domain, they tried to reformat my website's landing page making it look horrible.",,
"I wish webpage and email templates were a bit more customizable, but I suppose that what's you sacrifice with something that's so user-friendly.",,
"The UI gets clunky in some places, and minor changes that probably weren't necessary are fairly frequent.",,
With multiple Centers that becomes clumsy.,,
"Simple features like email forwarding, or displaying preview text within the email is not available.",wishes:features:Actionable,
It would be a great improvement to add in order to cut down on time.,,
It's like having to learn Esperanto - it only benefits a specific group of individuals who know the language.,UX,
I think it's a shame that creating ads in HubSpot has fewer functionalities than in the advertising tool itself.,,
"Thus with reference to that, It would be nice for the software to have and undo button which is readily visible and can be clicked.",,
It does not always identify things like paid media as the same specific labels they have on their home platforms thus making it hard to track individual ads and campaigns deployed for paid media.,,
"El acompañamiento de cerca te permite entender como puedes mejorar.

The properties are great but certainly limited in the contact record in terms of visibility.,,
"It doesn't really group contacts together in the one organisation, which in a B2B can make life difficult as we're not talking about one person buying one thing.",,
"Hard to say, if I had to nitpick it would be that when you send an email to multiple people it loses some tracking functionality.",Actionable:wishes:features,
"While they have them, sometimes you can't get completely granular.",,
It is not the end-all-be-all to marketing automation.,,

"HubSpot is also helping me to streamline many marketing activities, which adds value to our users' experience.",,
I love the marketing analytics and how easy it is to gather them and make data-backed decisions.,,
Easy enough to customize the code base for landing pages and email templates.,,
We can all work under one platform without stepping on toes or creating friction between projects.,,
"Using Hubspot Ads, creating Facebook Pixels has become an incredibly simple process that no longer confuses my tech team.",,
The customer support is brilliant and would often go the extra mile to help you even if it is not within their area of expertise.,,
"Being able to create event landing pages with registrations and automated emails and reminders through forms for our school events; Sending our school communications/newsletters; creating a variety of website page types (video galleries, info pages, content offers, etc.).",,
I can schedule 20 posts in 20 minutes using Hubspot because it's all in one place,,
"For social media, I love that I'm able to schedule up to 15 posts in one click.",,
I'm a huge fan!,,
"I absolutely love that all aspects of our online presence & communications can be managed from one ""hub.",,
"I can always reach a knowledgeable, friendly person who can help me figure out any glitches or problems I am experiencing.",,
This creates a version control problem between teams and and extra step for us—I add to Marketing Files and another team member then ads to the Sales Documents.,,

Creating new contacts with targeted audiences.,,
Setting up email workflows and being able to have consistent touchpoints with our clients or prospective customers is huge.,,

You may want to interview several Hubspot resellers to help you get set up and use Hubspot to its full potential.,,

"In addition, when I post curated content, it adds in the author mention for me",,
I actually had zero social media experience before using Hub Spot's Social platform.,,
"HubSpot was designed to be used by marketers who may not know how to code, so their GUI is easy to navigate and use, and their WYSIWYG display of landing pages, emails, etc is excellent, especially compared to some of their competitors.",,
I like being able to post for every single one of my accounts in one place.,,
"From their support, attention to customers needs, consistent and knowledgable content & courses, and their annual conference, HubSpot is providing marketers exactly what they need to be successful.",,

It has the perfect mix of ease of use and complexity.,,

"As a marketing operations manager, I spent most of my day on hubspot and it serves just about every function across our marketing team.",,
HubSpot is also great for teams.,,
Pretty user-friendly and you can quickly get support help when you need it.,,
I was first drawn to HubSpot in 2015.,,
We didn't have much automated previously,,
Be sure to know your future costs (based on number of users or number of contacts before you take the plunge.,,
"It can be expensive to run Hubspot,",,
"Además, con los módulos",,
"Their pricing by contacts can be a bit tricky when you're looking to use their CRM product, however, so be sure you walk through all of the use cases, contact counts, etc in advance of your purchase.",,
The creation of landing pages and accompanying lead generation forms has also been supremely helpful.,,
It's very easy to post things crossplatform and on multiple accounts at a time.,,
HubSpot is an excellent tool for managing B2B inbound marketing activities.,,
Being able to test completely different templates against each other really helps hone in on the messaging and styles that your prospects engage with.,,

I want to be able to just add in a space for a rich text field or a form space without updating the template everytime.,,

a la hora de evaluar y automatizar las acciones de marketing.,,
I make a lot of custom one-off templates for our marketing initiatives.,,
HubSpot has helped my company launch our inbound marketing strategy in 2019.,,
"I can't personally speak as much to the SEO/analytics because we use a subcontractor who manages that (we have her set up as one of our Hubspot users, but I have not dived into the analytics as much as I probably should!",,

"Marketing, sales, and service just works together.",,
it's intuitive and doesn't require a crazy amount of training.,,
Ensuring that we are able to engage with all potential leads and converts on the different digital touchpoints and automating the process as much as possible.,,
It's very easy to learn how to manage landing pages.,,
The A/B testing is really simple and intuitive to use.,,
